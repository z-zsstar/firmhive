The program executes constructed nvram commands via the system function, where external inputs are directly used to construct these commands without sufficient validation or filtering. Attackers could potentially inject arbitrary commands through carefully crafted inputs, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability trigger condition requires the ability to control parameters passed to the fbwifi program.", "code_snippet": "REDACTED_SENSITIVE_DATA", "link_identifiers": ["fbwifi", "system", "nvram set", "command injection"]}
