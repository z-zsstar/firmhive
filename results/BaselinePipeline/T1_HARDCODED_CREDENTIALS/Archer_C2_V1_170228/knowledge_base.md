### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hash

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak`
- **Location:** `etc/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak:1`
- **Risk Score:** 9.5
- **Confidence:** 9.0
- **Description:** A hardcoded REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash was discovered in the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak file. The file contains the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash '$1$$iC.REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER/' for the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER user with UID 0 (REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges). This constitutes a critical security vulnerability, as attackers could use this hash for offline cracking or direct system access. The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash uses the MD5 algorithm (prefix $1$), which is relatively easy to crack.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:$1$$iC.REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER/:0:0:REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:/:/bin/sh
  ```
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, $1$$iC.REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER/, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
