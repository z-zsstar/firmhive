- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/netatalk/afpd.conf`
- **Location:** `etc/netatalk/afpd.conf`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** In the netatalk service configuration, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-related settings were identified, specifying the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file path as REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER with REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER saving functionality enabled. The configuration shows the use of multiple authentication modules (REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, uams_dhx_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.so) and a minimum REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER length of 0, which may pose security risks.
