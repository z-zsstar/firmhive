### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hash

- **File/Directory Path:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER`
- **Location:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:1`
- **Risk Score:** 9.0
- **Confidence:** 8.75
- **Description:** The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash for the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER user was found in the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file. This hash is encrypted using the MD5 algorithm and can be cracked by REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-cracking tools. This poses a serious security risk that could lead to complete device compromise.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:$1$$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:0:0:REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:/bin/ash
  ```
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, $1$
- **Notes:** It is recommended to immediately change the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER or disable remote REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER login.

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hash-duplicate

- **File/Directory Path:** `.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER`
- **Location:** `.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:1`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** The encrypted REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash of the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER user was found in the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file. The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER is encrypted using the UNIX crypt algorithm and may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:$1$$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:0:0:REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:/bin/ash
  ```
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, $1$
- **Notes:** It is recommended to change this REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER immediately and use a stronger hashing algorithm such as SHA-512.
