### rcS-temporary-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-file

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/rc.d/rcS`
- **Location:** `etc/rc.d/rcS:36-38`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** The operation of creating a temporary REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file was discovered in the /etc/rc.d/rcS script, which writes REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER user information to /tmp/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER. Such temporary files could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain system access.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  # when disable nas, we need this to login
  ...
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  ```
- **Keywords:** /tmp/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** It is recommended to check whether the system relies on this temporary REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file for authentication and whether there are other security measures in place to prevent misuse.

### web-login-base64-auth

- **File/Directory Path:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.htm`
- **Location:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.htm:292-293`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** Base64-encoded authentication logic was found in the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.htm file, utilizing REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER and REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER combination for authentication.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  var auth = "Basic "+ Base64Encoding(REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER + ":" + REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER);
  ```
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, Base64Encoding
- **Notes:** Authentication logic, need to check the Base64Encoding function implementation

### shadow-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hash

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/shadow`
- **Location:** `etc/shadow:1`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash for the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER user was found in the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file. This hash uses the MD5 encryption algorithm (identified by $1$), containing a salt (GTN.gpri) and the encrypted REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER (REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER). This is a typical Unix REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER storage format, but the use of the weaker MD5 algorithm poses security risks. This hash is vulnerable to offline cracking tools.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:$1$GTN.gpri$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:15502:0:99999:7:::
  ```
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, $1$GTN.gpri$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, etc/shadow
- **Notes:** Recommendations: 1) This REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash can be cracked by brute-force tools 2) Upgrade to a more secure encryption algorithm such as SHA-512 ($6$) 3) Check if other user accounts also use weak encryption
