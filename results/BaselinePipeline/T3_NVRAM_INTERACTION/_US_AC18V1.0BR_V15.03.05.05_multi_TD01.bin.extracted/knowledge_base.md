### bin-netctrl-nvram-operations

- **File/Directory Path:** `bin/netctrl`
- **Location:** `bin/netctrl: 0x1cc98, 0x1f04c, 0x17088`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** Multiple NVRAM operations were found in bin/netctrl:
1. bcm_nvram_set call (0x1cc98): Sets NVRAM variables, with variable names loaded from memory addresses
2. bcm_nvram_match call (0x1f04c): Checks NVRAM variable values, with results directly controlling doSystemCmd execution
3. envram_get call (0x17088): Retrieves NVRAM variable values

Security risks:
- The result of bcm_nvram_match is directly used to execute system commands (doSystemCmd), which could lead to command injection if NVRAM variables are tampered with
- Variable names are not hardcoded, making it difficult to directly identify specific variables
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  N/A (HIDDEN)
  ```
- **Keywords:** bcm_nvram_set, bcm_nvram_match, envram_get, doSystemCmd, libnvram.so
- **Notes:** Further analysis of the memory address is required to determine the specific NVRAM variable name being accessed. The use of doSystemCmd introduces additional security risks.
