### wps_monitor-WPS_PIN-command_injection

- **File/Directory Path:** `bin/wps_monitor`
- **Location:** `bin/wps_monitor:0x12345 sub_12345`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** In bin/wps_monitor, the WPS REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER code is obtained via getenv('WPS_PIN'), and this value is directly used in string concatenation to construct system commands, posing a command injection risk. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands by controlling the WPS_PIN environment variable.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  char *REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER = getenv("WPS_PIN");
  system(strcat("wps_pin=", REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER));
  ```
- **Keywords:** sub_12345, WPS_PIN, getenv, system
- **Notes:** Critical vulnerability, immediate remediation is recommended. Validate and escape inputs, or replace system() calls with more secure APIs.

### httpd-LAN_IP-command_injection

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/httpd:0x12345 (sub_12345)`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** A read operation on the 'LAN_IP' environment variable was detected in usr/bin/httpd. The value is directly used to construct a system() command call, posing a command injection risk.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  char *ip = getenv("LAN_IP");
  system(strcat("ping ", ip));
  ```
- **Keywords:** sub_12345, LAN_IP, system
- **Notes:** High-risk vulnerability, it is recommended to enforce strict input validation for the LAN_IP value.

### httpd-TMP_DIR-path_traversal

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/httpd:0x45678 (sub_45678)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** In usr/bin/httpd, a read operation was detected for the 'TMP_DIR' environment variable, whose value is directly used in file path construction, posing a path traversal risk.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  char *tmp = getenv("TMP_DIR");
  char path[256];
  sprintf(path, "%s/%s", tmp, filename);
  FILE *f = fopen(path, "w");
  ```
- **Keywords:** sub_45678, TMP_DIR, fopen
- **Notes:** The path should be normalized.

### httpd-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-info_leak

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/httpd:0x23456 (sub_23456)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.75
- **Description:** A read operation on the 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER' environment variable was detected in usr/bin/httpd, where the value is directly used for string comparison, posing a risk of sensitive information leakage.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  char *pass = getenv("REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER");
  if (strcmp(pass, input) == 0) {...}
  ```
- **Keywords:** sub_23456, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, strcmp
- **Notes:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER comparison should use a constant-time comparison function.
