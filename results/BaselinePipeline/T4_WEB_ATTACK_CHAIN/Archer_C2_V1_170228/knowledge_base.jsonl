While no direct calls to dangerous functions such as strcpy/sprintf were observed, unsafe string operations, lack of user input length validation, and potential memory management issues were found. These problems may lead to buffer overflow or other security vulnerabilities. Trigger conditions include processing HTTP request parameters of specific formats. Potential impacts include remote code execution or service crashes.", "code_snippet": "HIDDENï¼ŒHIDDENsym.http_parser_mainHIDDENsym.http_cgi_main", "link_identifiers": ["sym.http_parser_main", "sym.http_cgi_main", "sym.http_parser_argStrToList", "sym.http_tool_argUnEscape", "sym.http_stream_fgets"], "notes": "Further analysis is required: 1) Inspect all HTTP parameter processing paths 2) Verify memory allocation and deallocation operations 3) Test boundary condition inputs. Special attention should be paid to the sym.http_parser_argStrToList and sym.http_tool_argUnEscape functions, as these may be critical points for user input processing."}
