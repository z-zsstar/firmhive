### httpd-strcpy-stack-overflow

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `0x403820 (fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER)`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 6.75
- **Description:** An unverified strcpy operation was identified in function fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, copying content from address 0x420000-0x1b70 to stack buffer auStack_498 (64 bytes). This operation may lead to stack buffer overflow, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code by controlling source data. Trigger conditions include: 1) Data at address 0x420000-0x1b70 must be user-controllable; 2) Data length exceeds 64 bytes. Potential impacts include remote code execution and system crashes.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  strcpy(auStack_498, 0x420000-0x1b70);
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, strcpy, auStack_498, 0x420000-0x1b70
- **Notes:** Further verification is required to determine whether the data source at addresses 0x420000-0x1b70 is user-controllable. If the data originates from HTTP request parameters, the risk level is extremely high.

### httpd-strcpy-heap-overflow

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `0x405898, 0x4058c4 (fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 6.75
- **Description:** An unverified strcpy operation was identified in function fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, copying content from *0x41e490 to a heap buffer. An attacker could potentially cause heap overflow or path traversal attacks by controlling the content of *0x41e490. Trigger conditions include: 1) *0x41e490 being user-controllable; 2) data length exceeding the target buffer size. Potential impacts include remote code execution and sensitive file access.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  strcpy(heap_buffer, *0x41e490);
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, strcpy, *0x41e490, index.htm
- **Notes:** *0x41e490 may contain user-supplied path information, such as filename parameters in HTTP requests.

### httpd-sprintf-format-string

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `0x4038ec, 0x40395c (fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.75
- **Description:** An unverified sprintf operation was identified in function fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, formatting a string into stack buffer auStack_218 (512 bytes). The format string incorporates content from external variables (*0x433a40, uVar7) and buffers (auStack_458, auStack_318), potentially leading to format string vulnerabilities or buffer overflows. Trigger conditions include: 1) external variables being user-controllable; 2) the format string containing malicious format specifiers. Potential impacts encompass information disclosure and remote code execution.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  sprintf(auStack_218, "%s%s", *0x433a40, uVar7);
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, sprintf, auStack_218, *0x433a40, uVar7
- **Notes:** It is necessary to analyze the filling sources of auStack_458 and auStack_318 to confirm whether they originate from HTTP request parameters.
