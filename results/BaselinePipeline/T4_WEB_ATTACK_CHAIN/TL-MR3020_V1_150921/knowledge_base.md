### httpd-dangerous-functions

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/httpd (HIDDEN)`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 6.75
- **Description:** Multiple dangerous function calls (system, strcpy, sprintf) were identified in the httpd binary, though it remains unconfirmed whether these functions directly process user-supplied HTTP parameters. Improper handling of these functions could potentially lead to severe vulnerabilities such as command injection or buffer overflow. Further analysis of the calling context is required to verify parameter origins.
- **Keywords:** sym.imp.system, sym.imp.strcpy, sym.imp.sprintf, sym.web_server_callback
- **Notes:** Since the binary file has its symbol table stripped, analysis is challenging. It is recommended to perform dynamic analysis to verify whether these function calls handle user input.

### httpd-web_server_callback

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/httpd (sym.web_server_callback)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER function for handling HTTP requests, web_server_callback, was identified, but no direct observation was made of user input being passed to dangerous functions. This function may serve as the primary entry point for HTTP request processing, requiring focused analysis of its parameter handling logic.
- **Keywords:** sym.web_server_callback, str.POST__goform_goform_process
- **Notes:** This is the core function for HTTP request handling; it is recommended to focus on analyzing its parameter processing flow through dynamic analysis or reverse engineering.
