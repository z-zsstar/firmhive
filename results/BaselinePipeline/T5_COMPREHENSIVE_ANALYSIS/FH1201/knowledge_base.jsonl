{"name": "nvram-set-buffer-overflow", "file_path": "bin/nvram", "location": "bin/nvram:0x400a80-0x400a8c", "risk_score": 8.5, "confidence": 7.75, "description": "A potential buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the `set` operation of `bin/nvram`. The program uses `strncpy` to copy user-supplied values to a stack buffer (sp+0x1c) but fails to properly validate input length. An attacker could craft an excessively long parameter to trigger stack overflow, potentially gaining control of program execution flow. This is a high-risk vulnerability as `nvram` typically operates with elevated privileges, and this operation can be triggered either via command line or network interface.", "code_snippet": "REDACTED_SENSITIVE_DATA", "link_identifiers": ["nvram_set", "strncpy", "sp+0x1c", "main"], "notes": "Further confirmation is required regarding the buffer size and the maximum possible length of user input. Potential attack vectors may include: 1) Direct execution via command line 2) Indirect invocation through web interfaces 3) Indirect invocation via other services."}

The program directly outputs user-controllable or NVRAM-retrieved data using `printf`/`fprintf`, which may lead to information disclosure or memory corruption.
