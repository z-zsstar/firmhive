### firewall-rule-injection-net-wall

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/sbin/net-wall`
- **Location:** `usr/sbin/net-wall (HIDDEN)`
- **Risk Score:** 9.0
- **Confidence:** 7.75
- **Description:** Multiple security issues were identified in usr/sbin/net-wall, including the use of the insecure strcpy function, command injection risks via the system function executing external scripts (REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.sh), and insufficient validation of user input for ioctl network interface configuration. These vulnerabilities could be chained to manipulate firewall rules or execute arbitrary commands. Trigger condition: An attacker can control input parameters or environment variables. Potential impact: Firewall rule bypass, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.
- **Keywords:** strcpy, system, ioctl, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.sh, wan_proto, wan_ifname
- **Notes:** Check if the script parameters are properly filtered

### command-injection-ntgr_sw_api-eval

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/scripts/ntgr_sw_api/ntgr_sw_api.sh`
- **Location:** `etc/scripts/ntgr_sw_api/ntgr_sw_api.sh:30,46`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** A command injection vulnerability was discovered in the eval command within etc/scripts/ntgr_sw_api/ntgr_sw_api.sh. The script uses eval to process content obtained from configuration files (SWAPI_PERSISTENT_CONN or MINIDLNA_CONF). If an attacker can control these configuration values, it may lead to command injection. Trigger condition: The attacker can modify relevant NVRAM configuration values. Potential impact: Remote code execution.
- **Keywords:** eval, SWAPI_PERSISTENT_CONN, MINIDLNA_CONF, ntgr_sw_api.sh
- **Notes:** It is necessary to confirm whether these configuration values can be modified through network interfaces or other external inputs.

### dynamic-rule-execution-firewall-sh

- **File/Directory Path:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.sh`
- **Location:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.sh:25-30,32-37`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** A vulnerability was identified in REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.sh where it dynamically loads and executes `${LIBDIR}/*.rule` files, posing a risk of arbitrary code execution. If an attacker can write .rule files (via upload vulnerabilities or directory traversal), arbitrary commands can be executed. Trigger conditions: 1) The attacker can create/modify .rule files under ${LIBDIR} 2) The administrator executes net-wall start/restart or directly calls this script. Potential impact: Full system compromise.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  ls ${LIBDIR}/*.rule | while read rule
  do
  	$SHELL $rule start
  done
  ```
- **Keywords:** LIBDIR, firewall_start, firewall_stop, .rule, $SHELL $rule
- **Notes:** Check the permissions and potential write points of the ${LIBDIR} directory. Recommendations: 1) Perform signature verification on .rule files 2) Restrict directory write permissions

### unsafe-string-operations-bin-config

- **File/Directory Path:** `bin/config`
- **Location:** `bin/config`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** Multiple dangerous string operations (strcpy, sprintf) were identified in bin/config, which may lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities when used with untrusted input. These functions are invoked within the configuration management logic, particularly surrounding 'config set' operations. Trigger condition: An attacker can supply malicious configuration values. Potential impact: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Keywords:** strcpy, sprintf, config_set, config_get
- **Notes:** Vulnerability confirmation requires dynamic analysis to validate input verification.

### strcpy-buffer-overflow-proccgi

- **File/Directory Path:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi`
- **Location:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi:0x888c`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 8.25
- **Description:** An insecure strcpy call was found in www/cgi-bin/proccgi, which may lead to buffer overflow. This function is used to process input strings. Although memory allocation is performed, strict length validation is lacking. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through carefully crafted input. Trigger condition: attackers can control input parameters. Potential impact: arbitrary code execution or service crash.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  0xREDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER      0410a0e1       mov r1, r4
  0x0000888c      5dffffeb       bl sym.imp.strcpy
  ```
- **Keywords:** proccgi, strcpy, fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, malloc
- **Notes:** Further analysis of input sources and call paths is required to identify the attack surface.

### buffer-overflow-nvram-config-set

- **File/Directory Path:** `bin/nvram`
- **Location:** `bin/nvram:0x8b50`
- **Risk Score:** 7.2
- **Confidence:** 7.15
- **Description:** A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the fcn.00008b50 function of bin/nvram. When processing the `config set name=value` command, an overflow may occur if the value parameter is excessively long. Attackers can trigger this vulnerability by crafting specially constructed name=value parameters. Trigger condition: The attacker is capable of sending or injecting config set commands. Potential impact: Arbitrary code execution or system crash.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  iVar1 = sym.imp.strlen();
  iVar1 = iVar1 + 0;
  if ((iVar1 != 0) && (*(param_1 + iVar1 + -1) == '
  ')) {
      iVar1 = iVar1 + -1;
  }
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.00008b50, strlen, config set, name=value
- **Notes:** Further analysis of the specific implementation of the config set command is required to confirm exploitability of the vulnerability.

### firewall-config-injection-ntgr_sw_api-rule

- **File/Directory Path:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_sw_api.rule`
- **Location:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_sw_api.rule:10-25`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** In REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_sw_api.rule, it was found that the firewall configuration lacks strict input validation. The script retrieves network interface, protocol, and port parameters from the configuration system and directly uses them to construct iptables rules without validating the legitimacy of interface names and protocol types. Trigger condition: An attacker can modify the relevant configuration. Potential impact: Firewall rule bypass or denial of service.
- **Keywords:** config get, iptables -I INPUT, iptables -I OUTPUT, FIREWALL_NVCONF_PREFIX, set $value
- **Notes:** The attacker needs to first obtain write permissions to the configuration system to exploit this vulnerability.
