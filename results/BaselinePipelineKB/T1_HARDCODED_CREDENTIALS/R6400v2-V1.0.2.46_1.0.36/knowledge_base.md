### email-smtp-auth-config

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `usr/sbin/email (HIDDEN)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 4.5
- **Description:** Identified strings related to SMTP authentication configuration, including smtp_auth_user and smtp_auth_pwd, which may be used to store REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDERs and passwords for email services. While no hardcoded REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER values are directly visible, these configuration item names indicate that the program handles sensitive authentication information.
- **Keywords:** smtp_auth_enable, smtp_auth_user, smtp_auth_pwd, g_REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER, acosFw_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** While authentication-related configuration item names were identified, no hardcoded REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER values were directly found. It is recommended to further analyze how the program obtains these authentication details, such as whether they are read from configuration files or NVRAM.
