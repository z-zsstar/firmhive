### binary-authentication_tokens

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `opt/remote/remote`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** Sensitive strings related to network sharing were detected, including keywords such as 'AuthInfo' and 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER', indicating the program handles authentication tokens.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  AuthInfo: [REDACTED], REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: [REDACTED]
  ```
- **Keywords:** AuthInfo, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** Decompilation of binaries is required to verify the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER processing logic

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-netatalk-password_file_configuration

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `etc/netatalk/afpd.conf`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 8.5
- **Description:** Although direct access to the afpREDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file content is unavailable, the existence and location (REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER) of the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file were confirmed through the afpd.conf configuration file. The configuration shows the system utilizes multiple authentication modules (REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, uams_dhx_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.so, etc.) and sets the minimum REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER length to 0 (REDACTED_PASSWORD_REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER 0), which may pose security risks.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDERfile = REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  uams list = REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER uams_dhx_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.so
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER = 0
  ```
- **Keywords:** afpd.conf, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDERfile, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, uams_dhx_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.so, REDACTED_PASSWORD_REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** Due to path access restrictions, the contents of the afpREDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file cannot be directly examined. It is recommended to further inspect this file in an environment with appropriate permissions, as it may contain user credentials in plaintext or encrypted form.

### binary-proxy_authentication_mechanism

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `opt/remote/remote`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.75
- **Description:** Hardcoded HTTP proxy authentication credentials were found in the binary file opt/remote/remote, including the proxy_user and proxy_password fields. Although the actual REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER value is not directly visible, the presence of a proxy authentication mechanism suggests the potential use of hardcoded credentials during runtime.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  Proxy-Authorization: Basic [REDACTED]
  ```
- **Keywords:** proxy_user, proxy_password, Proxy-Authorization: Basic
- **Notes:** binary_analysis
