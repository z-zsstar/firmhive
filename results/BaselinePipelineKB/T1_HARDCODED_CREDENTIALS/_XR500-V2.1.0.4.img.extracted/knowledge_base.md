### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hardcoded-rsa_private_key-uhttpd

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `etc/uhttpd.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER`
- **Risk Score:** 10.0
- **Confidence:** 10.0
- **Description:** A hardcoded RSA private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER was found in the file `etc/uhttpd.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER`. This is a PEM-formatted private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER used for SSL/TLS encrypted communication. Leakage of the private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or service impersonation. This is a complete RSA private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER and should be immediately removed or replaced in the production environment. It is recommended to check whether other services are using the same REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-----
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  -----END RSA PRIVATE REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-----
  ```
- **Keywords:** uhttpd.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, RSA PRIVATE REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, PEM
- **Notes:** This is a complete RSA private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER and should be immediately removed or replaced from the production environment. It is recommended to check whether other services are using the same REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-ssl_private_key-client

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_key.pem`
- **Risk Score:** 9.5
- **Confidence:** 9.5
- **Description:** An RSA private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER was found in the `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_key.pem` file. This is highly sensitive information, and if leaked, it could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security threats.
- **Keywords:** client_key.pem, RSA PRIVATE REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** ssl_private_key

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-ssl_certificate-client

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_cert.pem`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 9.0
- **Description:** Found client certificate in the file `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_cert.pem`. When combined with the private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file, it may form a complete REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER pair.
- **Keywords:** client_cert.pem, CERTIFICATE
- **Notes:** The certificate file paired with the discovered private REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file, forming a complete REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER pair.

### vpn-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-handling-issue

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.sh:34-36, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.sh:34-36`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** The scripts `ipvanish.sh` and `hidemyass.sh` accept REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDERs and passwords as command-line arguments and write these credentials to a temporary file `${ovpn_client_user_file}`. Security risks exist: 1) Command-line arguments may be exposed via process listings 2) Temporary files may be accessed without authorization 3) Lack of secure REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER storage mechanisms.
- **Keywords:** connect_server, ovpn_client_user_file, printf "%s\n" "$3" "$4", auth-user-pass
- **Notes:** It is recommended to use secure REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER storage methods and avoid passing sensitive information through command lines.

### hardcoded-ssl-paths-authcurl

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/authcurl:7`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** Hardcoded SSL certificate and REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER paths were found in the authcurl script. The script loads fixed files /etc/ssl/certs/CA.cert.pem, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_cert.pem, and REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_key.pem when using the curl command. This may pose security risks because: 1) The paths are fixed, making certificate rotation difficult; 2) The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file locations are exposed; 3) Improper file permissions could lead to information disclosure.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  curl --cacert /etc/ssl/certs/CA.cert.pem --cert REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_cert.pem --REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_key.pem "$@"
  ```
- **Keywords:** /etc/ssl/certs/CA.cert.pem, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_cert.pem, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_key.pem, curl, --cacert, --cert, --REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** It is recommended to verify the actual content and permission settings of these certificate files. If these certificates are used for critical communications, implementing a more secure certificate management solution should be considered.

### potential-sensitive-files-locations

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `[HIDDEN]`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.25
- **Description:** Due to system restrictions preventing direct access to the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER file, but having obtained a complete filesystem listing, it is recommended to focus on the following file paths that may contain sensitive information:
1. Configuration files: ./etc/config/*, ./etc/init.d/*
2. Script files: ./bin/*, ./sbin/*
3. User data files: .REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, ./usr/config/group

Further analysis of the contents of these files is required to locate hardcoded credentials. Given the current environmental limitations, it is advised to directly inspect these files in an environment with full permissions.
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, group, shadow, credentials, config
- **Notes:** System security restrictions prevent direct access to critical files. It is recommended to perform a complete analysis in an environment with REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges. Files requiring inspection include, but are not limited to: user authentication-related files such as REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, etc.

### restricted-access-files

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `[HIDDEN]`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 5.5
- **Description:** Access to multiple system configuration files (REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, shadow, etc.) and CGI script contents is restricted due to security limitations.
- **Keywords:** etc/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, etc/shadow, uhttpd.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, firewall.sh, func.sh
- **Notes:** It is recommended to further inspect these files in an environment with appropriate permissions, especially REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER and SSL certificate files.
