### command_injection-cgibin-fcn.0000ec7c

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0xf4a4,0xf5c8,0xf6ec,0xf6f8,0xf81c,0xf828,0xf834,0xf900`
- **Risk Score:** 9.5
- **Confidence:** 7.75
- **Description:** Multiple instances of unverified direct calls to system() were found in function fcn.0000ec7c, potentially allowing arbitrary command execution. Particularly when parameters take specific values (such as cases 2-5), environment variables or fixed strings are directly concatenated to execute system commands.
- **Keywords:** fcn.0000ec7c, system, 0xd274, 0xd340, 0xd398, 0xd3f0, 0xd410, 0xd430
- **Notes:** It is necessary to examine how HTTP requests affect the transmission path of these parameters.

### command_injection-cgibin-fcn.0001eaf0

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x1eaf0 (fcn.0001eaf0)`
- **Risk Score:** 9.0
- **Confidence:** 8.25
- **Description:** A command injection vulnerability was discovered in the fcn.0001eaf0 function of the htdocs/cgibin program. This function directly executes commands using system() (address 0x598), with parameters derived from the user-controlled QUERY_STRING environment variable. Since the program runs with REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges (setuid 0), an attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request to inject arbitrary commands through the QUERY_STRING parameter.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  sym.imp.system(0x598 | 0x30000);
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.0001eaf0, system, QUERY_STRING, getenv
- **Notes:** Further verification is required regarding the specific parameter transmission path and triggering conditions. It is recommended to conduct dynamic analysis to confirm the exploitability of the vulnerability.

### buffer_overflow-cgibin-multiple

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x1eaf0 (fcn.0001eaf0)`
- **Risk Score:** 9.0
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** Multiple buffer overflow risks were identified in the htdocs/cgibin program. The program utilizes insecure functions such as strcpy and strncat to process user input, potentially allowing attackers to trigger buffer overflows by crafting malicious HTTP requests. Since the program runs with REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges (setuid 0), the severity of these vulnerabilities is significantly increased.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  sym.imp.strcpy(*(puVar9 + -0x20),*(puVar9 + -0x24));
  ```
- **Keywords:** strcpy, strncat, QUERY_STRING, getenv
- **Notes:** Further verification is required regarding the specific input sources and buffer size limitations.

### buffer_overflow-cgibin-fcn.0001b228

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x1b5c4-0x1b8e0`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.5
- **Description:** Multiple functions contain unvalidated use of strcpy (e.g., fcn.0001b228), which may lead to buffer overflow. Particularly when processing HTTP request parameters, input length is not checked before copying into fixed-size buffers.
- **Keywords:** fcn.0001b228, strcpy, 0x1b5c4, 0x1b634, 0x1b650, 0x1b7fc, 0x1b818, 0x1b890, 0x1b8a8, 0x1b8c4, 0x1b8e0
- **Notes:** Need to confirm whether these buffers receive HTTP request parameters

### format_string-cgibin-multiple

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x1eaf0 (fcn.0001eaf0)`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.75
- **Description:** A format string vulnerability was discovered in the htdocs/cgibin program. The program uses sprintf to process user input data, allowing attackers to potentially exploit this vulnerability for memory read/write or code execution by crafting malicious HTTP requests. Since the program runs with REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges (setuid 0), the severity of this vulnerability is significantly increased.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  sym.imp.sprintf(*(puVar9 + -0x20),0x5fc | 0x30000,...);
  ```
- **Keywords:** sprintf, QUERY_STRING, getenv
- **Notes:** Further verification is required regarding the specific content and controllability of the formatted string.

### command_injection-cgibin-fcn.0000ec7c

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** A more dangerous pattern was identified in the fcn.0000ec7c function: using sprintf to construct a command string (0xd488 | 0x20000) followed by directly invoking the system function for execution. Additionally, multiple hardcoded system calls exist (0xd274 | 0x20000, 0xd340 | 0x20000, etc.). These patterns indicate potential command injection risks, particularly when external inputs can influence the command string constructed by sprintf.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  sym.imp.sprintf(piVar5 + -0x14c,0xd488 | 0x20000,piVar5 + -0x10c);
  sym.imp.system(fcn.0000d49c | 0x20000);
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.0000ec7c, sym.imp.system, sym.imp.sprintf, 0xd488, 0xd274, 0xd340
- **Notes:** Further analysis is required on the input sources of sprintf to determine if there are any externally controllable input paths. It is recommended to examine the HTTP request handling process, particularly how GET/POST parameters are passed into these functions.

### command_injection-httpd-0x1dfcc

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `sbin/httpd:0x1dfcc`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** A potential command injection vulnerability has been identified in the httpd binary. The system function is called at address 0x1dfcc, with string formatting performed using vsnprintf prior to the call. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by controlling the content of the format string.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  bl sym.imp.system
  ```
- **Keywords:** system, vsnprintf, 0x1dfcc
- **Notes:** Further analysis of the call chain is required to confirm whether user input is controllable. It is recommended to examine the relationship between the HTTP request handling function and this system call.

### command_injection-cgibin-fcn.0001eaf0

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x1ec84,0x1ed10`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 6.5
- **Description:** The function fcn.0001eaf0 contains a command injection vulnerability, where external programs are executed via execlp() without sufficient parameter validation. Particularly when processing specific path parameters (0x538 | 0x30000), malicious commands could potentially be injected.
- **Keywords:** fcn.0001eaf0, execlp, 0x538, 0x54c, 0x558
- **Notes:** Need to confirm whether these parameters are from the HTTP request

### command_injection-cgibin-fcn.0001f320

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x1f3d8`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 6.5
- **Description:** The function fcn.0001f320 contains a risk of executing unvalidated commands via popen(), where the command string is dynamically generated using sprintf() (0xb00 | 0x30000), potentially allowing injection of malicious commands.
- **Keywords:** fcn.0001f320, popen, sprintf, 0xb00, 0xb04
- **Notes:** Check whether the input parameters are controllable

### hardcoded_system-cgibin-fcn.0000e244

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 6.0
- **Description:** Multiple system calls in function fcn.0000e244 were found using hardcoded command strings (0xcfec | 0x20000, 0xd024 | 0x20000, 0xd050 | 0x20000). Although currently hardcoded, if these command strings can be modified by external input, it may lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  sym.imp.system(fcn.0000d49c | 0x20000);
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.0000e244, sym.imp.system, 0xcfec, 0xd024, 0xd050
- **Notes:** Need to confirm whether these hard-coded strings will be modified by external input

### command_injection-cgibin-fcn.0000ec7c-getenv

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0xeeb4,0xeed0`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.5
- **Description:** In function fcn.0000ec7c, the environment variable obtained via getenv() is directly used for command execution (0xd11c | 0x20000), which may lead to command injection. The environment variable could be tainted by HTTP request headers.
- **Keywords:** fcn.0000ec7c, getenv, system, 0xd11c, 0xd118
- **Notes:** Environment variables may be polluted by HTTP request headers
