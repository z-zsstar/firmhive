Further dynamic analysis is required to confirm potential command injection or buffer overflow vulnerabilities.", "code_snippet": "N/A (binary analysis)", "link_identifiers": ["/cgi/softup", "/cgi/confup"], "notes": "Since the binary has been stripped, function names and symbol information are missing, limiting static analysis. It is recommended to perform dynamic testing to verify the security of these CGI endpoints."}
