### system-call-fcn.0000deec

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0xe78c fcn.0000deec`
- **Risk Score:** 9.0
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** A call to system() was found in function fcn.0000deec (address 0xe78c), used for executing system commands. This function handles file operations, with the command string sourced from memory address 0xa394 | 0x20000, potentially allowing command execution control via HTTP parameters.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  system call at 0xe78c with command from 0xa394
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.0000deec, system, 0xe78c, 0xa394
- **Notes:** Further verification is needed on how HTTP parameters influence the construction of command strings.

### system-calls-fcn.0000eab0

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0xf250-0xf4a4 fcn.0000eab0`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** Multiple system() calls were found in function fcn.0000eab0 (addresses 0xf250-0xf4a4), handling different types of requests (case 2-4). These calls execute specific scripts (commands at addresses like 0xa5b8, 0xa684, 0xa6dc, etc.), potentially controlling execution flow through HTTP parameters.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  multiple system calls at 0xf250, 0xf374, 0xf498, 0xf4a4
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.0000eab0, system, 0xf250, 0xf374, 0xf498, 0xf4a4
- **Notes:** Request type controlled via parameters may enable arbitrary command execution

### system-sprintf-fcn.00012be4

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x12d28 fcn.00012be4`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** A call to system() is found in function fcn.00012be4 (address 0x12d28), constructing and executing a command string. The command string is built via sprintf and incorporates data from environment variables and HTTP parameters.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  system call at 0x12d28 with command constructed by sprintf
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.00012be4, system, sprintf, 0x12d28, 0xadb4
- **Notes:** Verify how environment variables and parameters affect command construction

### system-call-fcn.000175f4

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:0x17a50 fcn.000175f4`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** A system() call is found in function fcn.000175f4 (address 0x17a50), executing constructed command strings. This function processes HTTP request parameters and may potentially inject malicious commands through parameter manipulation.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  system call at 0x17a50 with constructed command
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.000175f4, system, 0x17a50, 0x7544
- **Notes:** Command execution involves multiple parameters and requires detailed analysis of injection points.

### cgibin-dangerous-functions

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `cgibin`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 6.5
- **Description:** Multiple dangerous functions (system, strcpy, sprintf, etc.) were identified in the cgibin binary, along with login form processing paths '/goform/form_login' and 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_login'. The system exhibits the following risk characteristics:
- Use of system() for executing external commands
- Unvalidated HTTP parameter handling (login_n, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER)
- Multiple CGI endpoints (dlcfg.cgi, session.cgi) potentially sharing the same parameter processing logic
- Potential command injection vulnerabilities (e.g., rndimage command construction)

While direct evidence of form_login parameters being passed to dangerous functions couldn't be confirmed due to stripped symbols, these patterns indicate the system carries significant security risks.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  HIDDENï¼š
  - '/goform/form_login'
  - 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER_login'
  - 'login_n'
  - 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER'
  - 'rndimage'
  ```
- **Keywords:** system, strcpy, sprintf, form_login, login_n, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, rndimage, dlcfg.cgi, session.cgi, goform/form_login
- **Notes:** It is recommended to conduct further analysis:
1. Perform dynamic testing on the form_login interface and attempt parameter injection
2. Examine the parameter validation logic in other CGI handlers
3. Pay special attention to the parameter construction method of the rndimage command

### strcpy-sprintf-unsafe

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `htdocs/cgibin:HIDDEN`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.5
- **Description:** Multiple instances of unsafe usage of strcpy and sprintf were identified across various functions, potentially leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Examples include strcpy calls in fcn.00019eb8 (address 0x1a254, etc.) and sprintf calls in fcn.0000a2d8 (address 0xa5c0, etc.).
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  unsafe strcpy at 0x1a254, sprintf at 0xa5c0
  ```
- **Keywords:** strcpy, sprintf, fcn.00019eb8, fcn.0000a2d8
- **Notes:** Validate the length and content of input data.
