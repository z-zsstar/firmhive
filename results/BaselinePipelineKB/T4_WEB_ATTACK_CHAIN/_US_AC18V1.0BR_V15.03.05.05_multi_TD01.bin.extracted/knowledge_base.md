### httpd-command_injection-0xa60f0

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `bin/httpd:0xa60f0`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** A potential command injection vulnerability was discovered at address 0xa60f0 in the httpd binary. The system() call constructs a command string using sprintf, which incorporates parameters from user input (unaff_r11 + -0x10c) without adequate filtering. Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary commands by crafting malicious input.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  system()HIDDENsprintfHIDDENï¼ŒHIDDEN(unaff_r11 + -0x10c)
  ```
- **Keywords:** system, sprintf, unaff_r11, 0xa60f0
- **Notes:** Further verification is required to confirm whether the user input is indeed controllable and whether the filtering mechanism is sufficient.

### web-goform-potential_cgi

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `webroot_ro/goform/`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 6.5
- **Description:** The .txt files in the goform directory may be CGI interfaces, but their content cannot be directly analyzed. Further analysis is required to understand how these files process HTTP requests.
- **Keywords:** goform, SysToolReboot.txt, REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER.txt
- **Notes:** Obtain the processing logic or binary analysis of these files to confirm security.

### web-systemjs-unsafe_operations

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `webroot_ro/js/system.js`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** The system.js file contains multiple system operation functions (such as restart, upgrade, configuration restore, etc.) that directly accept user input and execute without sufficient input parameter validation. Attackers may construct malicious requests to cause system exceptions or perform unauthorized operations.
- **Keywords:** system_reboot, system_upgrade, system_backup, system_config
- **Notes:** Further verification is required for the HTTP request handling logic of these features to confirm the presence of CSRF protection and input validation.
