### uhttpd-command-injection

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `usr/sbin/uhttpd`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.25
- **Description:** In the do_uh_cgi_request function of uhttpd, direct calls to the system function were identified, potentially leading to command injection vulnerabilities. This function processes HTTP requests without adequately validating user input, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands by crafting malicious requests.
- **Keywords:** uhttpd, do_uh_cgi_request, system, command_injection
- **Notes:** Further analysis is required on the parameter sources of the do_uh_cgi_request function to confirm the specific HTTP request parameter transmission path. It is recommended to replace the system call with more secure functions.

### net-cgi-buffer-overflow

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `usr/sbin/net-cgi`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.25
- **Description:** In the fcn.0000e848 function of net-cgi, unvalidated user input was found to be passed to strcpy and sprintf functions, potentially leading to buffer overflow. This function lacks input validation when processing HTTP requests, allowing attackers to trigger memory corruption by crafting malicious requests.
- **Keywords:** net-cgi, fcn.0000e848, strcpy, sprintf, buffer_overflow
- **Notes:** Further analysis of the fcn.0000e848 function's calling context is required to verify how specific HTTP request parameters are passed to the dangerous function. It is recommended to use more secure string handling functions.

### vulnerability-proccgi-strcpy-overflow

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi:0x87f0 fcn.000087c8`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** An unsafe strcpy call was identified in the fcn.000087c8 function of the proccgi binary. This function accepts an external input parameter (param_1), allocates a buffer via malloc, and directly passes it to strcpy without sufficient boundary checks. Attackers could potentially trigger a buffer overflow by crafting malicious HTTP request parameters. Further verification is required to determine whether param_1 originates directly from HTTP request parameters.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  sym.imp.strcpy(iVar1,param_1);
  ```
- **Keywords:** proccgi, fcn.000087c8, sym.imp.strcpy, sym.imp.malloc, HTTP_request
- **Notes:** Further verification is required to determine whether param_1 originates directly from HTTP request parameters. It is recommended to examine the parent function calling fcn.000087c8, particularly the processing logic related to HTTP environment variables (such as QUERY_STRING).

### ozker-dangerous-functions

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `usr/sbin/ozker`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.75
- **Description:** In the usr/sbin/ozker binary file, HTTP parameter retrieval points (FCGX_GetParam) and dangerous function calls (system/strcpy) were identified. Current analysis tools have limitations in fully tracing the complete propagation path from HTTP parameters to dangerous functions. Further analysis is required for:
- The context of the system call at 0x1289c
- Call points of functions such as strcpy
- The complete path of parameter processing flow
- **Keywords:** ozker, FCGX_GetParam, system, strcpy, sprintf, 0x1289c
- **Notes:** Deeper analysis tools or manual reverse engineering are required to fully trace the transmission path of HTTP parameters to dangerous functions. Pay special attention to the system call at 0x1289c.
