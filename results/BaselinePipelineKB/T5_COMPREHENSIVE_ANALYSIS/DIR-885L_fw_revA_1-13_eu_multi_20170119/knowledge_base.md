### nvram-erase-vulnerability

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `etc/scripts/erase_nvram.sh:1-13`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** The script retrieves the NVRAM's MTD device number from /proc/mtd and uses the dd command to zero out the first 32 bytes of NVRAM. Potential risks include: 1) If an attacker can control the content of /proc/mtd or the NVRAM_MTD_NUM variable, it may lead to erasing the wrong device; 2) The dd command does not verify whether the output device is actually an NVRAM device; 3) If the script is improperly invoked (e.g., through a web interface or other services), it may result in accidental erasure of NVRAM data.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  NVRAM_MTD_NUM=\`cat /proc/mtd | grep '"nvram"' | cut -d ':' -f 1 | cut -b 4-\`
  NVRAM_MTDBLOCK="/dev/mtdblock/$NVRAM_MTD_NUM"
  
  if [ "x$NVRAM_MTD_NUM" != "x" ]; then
  	if [ -e $NVRAM_MTDBLOCK ]; then
  		echo "Erase nvram data"
  		dd if=/dev/zero of=$NVRAM_MTDBLOCK bs=1 count=32 1>/dev/null 2>&1
  	fi
  fi
  ```
- **Keywords:** NVRAM_MTD_NUM, NVRAM_MTDBLOCK, /proc/mtd, dd, /dev/zero, /dev/mtdblock
- **Notes:** It is necessary to check which components in the system may invoke this script.
