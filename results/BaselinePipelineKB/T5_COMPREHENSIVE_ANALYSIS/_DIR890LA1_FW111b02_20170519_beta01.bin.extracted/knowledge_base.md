### buffer_overflow-httpd-fcn.0001331c

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `sbin/httpd:0x1331c (fcn.0001331c) 0x13628,0x13720`
- **Risk Score:** 9.5
- **Confidence:** 8.25
- **Description:** A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the function fcn.0001331c of sbin/httpd. Specifically, strcpy is used at addresses 0x13628 and 0x13720 to copy user-controllable data without checking the destination buffer size. Attackers can trigger buffer overflow by crafting HTTP requests with excessively long parameters, potentially leading to remote code execution. Vulnerability trigger conditions: 1) Attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests; 2) Requests contain overly long parameters; 3) Parameters are passed to strcpy call locations.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  strcpy(dest, src); // 0x13628
  strcpy(dest2, src2); // 0x13720
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.0001331c, strcpy@0x13628, strcpy@0x13720, httpd_buffer_overflow
- **Notes:** Dynamic analysis is required to confirm the exploitability of the vulnerability. It is recommended to inspect the HTTP request handling process, particularly the parsing of URL parameters and POST data.
