### hardcoded-creds-httpd-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `bin/httpd`
- **Risk Score:** 9.0
- **Confidence:** 8.75
- **Description:** Hardcoded credentials found in the httpd binary. The strings reveal default REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER credentials ('REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER') and WPS REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER ('REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER') which could allow unauthorized access if not changed by the user. This provides an initial attack vector for gaining administrative access to the device.
- **Keywords:** sys.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER

### weak-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hashes-etc_ro

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `etc_ro/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:1-5, etc_ro/shadow:1`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** In the etc_ro directory, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER and shadow files containing REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hashes for multiple user accounts were discovered. The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER is stored using the insecure MD5 algorithm (indicated by the $1$ prefix), and the shadow file only protects the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER account while exposing hashes for other accounts. This configuration enables attackers to potentially gain system access through offline cracking, particularly when these hashes might be used for authentication across multiple services.
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, shadow, $1$nalENqL8$jnRFwb1x5S.ygN.3nwTbG1, $1$OVhtCyFa$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, support, user
- **Notes:** These REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hashes may be used for authentication across multiple services such as SSH, FTP, and web management interfaces. Recommendations: 1) Verify whether these hashes are reused elsewhere in the system; 2) Analyze the authentication mechanisms in relevant service configuration files (smb.conf/vsftpd.conf); 3) Assess the potential for pass-the-hash attacks.

### form-handler-cmd-injection-httpd

- **File/Directory Path:** `N/A`
- **Location:** `bin/httpd:0xREDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.75
- **Description:** Critical security issues were identified in the form processing function sym.form_fast_setting_internet_set within bin/httpd: 1) Direct execution of system commands via doSystemCmd using unvalidated user input parameters, creating a complete command injection attack vector; 2) Setting NVRAM values through SetValue without proper input validation, potentially enabling device configuration tampering; 3) Committing changes to flash memory via CommitCfm. This combination of operations forms a complete attack chain from network interface to persistent configuration modification.
- **Keywords:** sym.form_fast_setting_internet_set, doSystemCmd, SetValue, CommitCfm, fast_setting_internet_set.txt, /goform/fast_setting
- **Notes:** This finding demonstrates a complete attack path from network input (/goform/fast_setting) to system command execution (doSystemCmd) and persistent configuration modification (SetValue+CommitCfm). Special attention should be paid to: 1) parameter filtering mechanism of doSystemCmd; 2) input validation of SetValue; 3) call relationships of relevant form processing functions.
