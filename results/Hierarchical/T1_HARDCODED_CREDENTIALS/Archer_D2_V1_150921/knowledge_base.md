### hardcoded_credentials-vsftpd_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/vsftpd_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER`
- **Location:** `etc/vsftpd_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER`
- **Risk Score:** 9.0
- **Confidence:** 9.0
- **Description:** The file 'etc/vsftpd_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER' contains multiple hardcoded credentials in the format 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:flag1:flag2'. These credentials are stored in plaintext, posing a significant security risk. The specific credentials identified are as follows:
1. REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER', REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: '1234'
2. REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: 'guest', REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: 'guest'
3. REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: 'test', REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: 'test'

This storage method allows unauthorized users to easily obtain and use these credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the vsftpd service.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:1234:1:1;guest:guest:0:0;test:test:1:1;$
  ```
- **Keywords:** vsftpd_REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:1234, guest:guest, test:test
- **Notes:** It is recommended to remove or protect this file and use a more secure authentication mechanism. REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER type: REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER and REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-md5_hash-cwmp

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/cwmp`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/cwmp: (cwmpHIDDEN)`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 8.5
- **Description:** A hardcoded MD5 hash 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER' was detected, potentially serving as credentials for authentication or verification. This hash appears in the CWMP protocol processing code. Verification is required to determine its specific purpose, which may represent a hardcoded REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER or cryptographic REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.
- **Keywords:** MD5_Init, MD5_Update, MD5_Final, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** Need to confirm the specific purpose of this hash value, which could be a hardcoded REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER or REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hardcoded-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak`
- **Location:** `etc/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak:1`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** A hardcoded administrator REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash was found in the 'etc/REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak' file. The hash uses the MD5 algorithm (identified by the $1$ prefix) with the value '$1$$iC.REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER/'. This account has REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges (both UID and GID are 0) and uses /bin/sh as the default shell. This storage method poses security risks since MD5 hashes can be brute-forced, and the account possesses the highest system privileges.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:$1$$iC.REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER/:0:0:REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:/:/bin/sh
  ```
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.bak, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, $1$$iC.REDACTED_SECRET_KEY_PLACEHOLDER/, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, /bin/sh
- **Notes:** Recommendations: 1) Verify if this REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER account is active in the system 2) Attempt to crack this MD5 hash 3) Check other locations in the system for the same credentials 4) Recommend using more secure REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER storage methods such as SHA-256 or bcrypt

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-hardcoded-default-accounts

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/cli`
- **Location:** `cliHIDDEN`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** Hardcoded default REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER fields were identified, including REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, and user-level accounts. These credentials are stored in plaintext within binary files and could potentially be exploited for unauthorized access if left unchanged from default values. The strings revealed REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER field names (RootName, RootPwd, etc.) but did not display actual values.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  N/A
  ```
- **Keywords:** RootName, RootPwd, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, USER_CFG, rootName, rootPwd, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
- **Notes:** Although the actual REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER values are not visible in the string, the presence of these fields indicates that the system is using default credentials, which should be changed during setup.

### permission-ebtables-excessive

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/ebtables`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/ebtables`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** The permissions of the file 'usr/bin/ebtables' are set to '-rwxrwxrwx', allowing all users to read, write, and execute, which poses potential security risks. Although no hardcoded credentials were found, overly permissive permissions may lead to unauthorized access or modification.
- **Keywords:** ebtables, rwxrwxrwx
- **Notes:** It is recommended to restrict file permissions, allowing access only to necessary users or groups.

### hardcoded-dhcp6s-config

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/sbin/dhcp6s`
- **Location:** `usr/sbin/dhcp6s`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** Multiple hardcoded paths and port information were found in the dhcp6s binary:

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/vsftpd`
- **Location:** `usr/bin/vsftpd`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** Hardcoded credentials and sensitive information were found in the file 'usr/bin/vsftpd'. Specifically, the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER' and REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER '1234' were identified, stored in plaintext, making them easily guessable and exploitable.
