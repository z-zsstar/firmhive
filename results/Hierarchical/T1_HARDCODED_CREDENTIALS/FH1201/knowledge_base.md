- **Description:** The script 'pppoeconfig.sh' handles sensitive information insecurely by writing REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER and REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER in plaintext to configuration files. Credentials are passed as command-line arguments ($1 and $2) and written to '/etc/ppp/option.pppoe.wan$UNIT' where $UNIT is determined by the network interface. This insecure handling could lead to REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER exposure if the configuration files are improperly secured.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  echo user \'$USER\' >>$CONFIG_FILE
  echo REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER \'$PSWD\' >>$CONFIG_FILE
  ```
- **Keywords:** USER, PSWD, CONFIG_FILE, option.pppoe.wan, pppoeconfig.sh

### REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-md5

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc_ro/shadow`
- **Location:** `etc_ro/shadow`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER hash for the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER user was found in the 'etc_ro/shadow' file. The hash is '$1$OVhtCyFa$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER', encrypted using the MD5 algorithm. The MD5 algorithm is considered weak by modern security standards and may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:$1$OVhtCyFa$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:14319::::::
  ```
- **Keywords:** REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, $1$OVhtCyFa$REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, shadow
- **Notes:** Although the REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER is not stored in plaintext, using MD5 hashing poses a security risk. It is recommended to examine known vulnerabilities of the MD5 algorithm or attempt to crack the hash under authorized circumstances.
