### env_get-http_rpm_auth_main-pwd

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/bin/httpd`
- **Location:** `httpd:0x409b20 sym.http_rpm_auth_main`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.75
- **Description:** The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER variable is directly used in authentication logic, which could lead to authentication bypass if maliciously controlled. This variable is obtained via the http_parser_getEnv function without adequate input validation.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  Not available in provided data
  ```
- **Keywords:** http_parser_getEnv, pwd, http_rpm_auth_main
- **Notes:** Although no direct getenv calls were found, a similar functionality was implemented through the custom function http_parser_getEnv. It is recommended to further analyze the implementation details of this function to assess its security.
