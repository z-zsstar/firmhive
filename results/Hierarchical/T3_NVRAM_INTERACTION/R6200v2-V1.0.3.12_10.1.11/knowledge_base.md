### env_get-network_config-fcn.000151b4

- **File/Directory Path:** `sbin/acos_service`
- **Location:** `./sbin/acos_service: (fcn.000151b4, fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER)`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 8.25
- **Description:** The functions fcn.000151b4 and fcn.REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER were found to access environment variables for network configuration and routing management. The environment variable values are directly used in system commands (such as ifconfig and route) without apparent sanitization, posing a command injection risk.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  Strings found: getenv, ifconfig, route_add, route_del
  ```
- **Keywords:** getenv, system, ifconfig, route_add, route_del
- **Notes:** It is recommended to audit all environment variables accessed through these functions and implement input validation

### nvram_set-acosNvramConfig_set

- **File/Directory Path:** `sbin/acos_service`
- **Location:** `./sbin/acos_service: (HIDDEN)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** The write operations to NVRAM were detected at multiple locations, where the environment variable values were stored into NVRAM through the acosNvramConfig_set function, potentially leading to persistent system compromise.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  Strings found: acosNvramConfig_set, acosNvramConfig_get
  ```
- **Keywords:** acosNvramConfig_set, acosNvramConfig_get
- **Notes:** Review the permission requirements for NVRAM storage

### env-get-proxy_variables

- **File/Directory Path:** `bin/wget`
- **Location:** `./bin/wget:sym.getproxy (0x24b64)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 8.0
- **Description:** Used to set up a proxy server. Although strncpy with a fixed buffer (0x400 bytes) is employed, excessively long values may still cause issues. Must include:
- Retrieving http_proxy/https_proxy/ftp_proxy environment variables
- Using strncpy to copy into a fixed-size buffer
- May lead to proxy configuration hijacking
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  Not provided in original data
  ```
- **Keywords:** getproxy, http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, strncpy
- **Notes:** If environment variables are controlled by an attacker, it may lead to proxy configuration hijacking.

### nvram-wps_monitor-wps_credentials

- **File/Directory Path:** `bin/wps_monitor`
- **Location:** `./bin/wps_monitor`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 4.0
- **Description:** The file utilizes Broadcom-specific 'nvram_get' and 'nvram_set' functions to access NVRAM. Over 70 WPS-related NVRAM variable names were identified, including sensitive information such as 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER' and 'wps_psk'. Although a significant number of variable names were identified, it was not possible to precisely map each call point. Further analysis is required to confirm whether these variables are handled securely.
- **Keywords:** nvram_get, nvram_set, REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER, wps_psk
- **Notes:** Further analysis is required to confirm whether these variables are securely handled.
