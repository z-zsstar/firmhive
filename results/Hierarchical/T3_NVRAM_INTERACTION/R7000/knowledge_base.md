### nvram-wwan_runtime_manuf-unsafe_access

- **File/Directory Path:** `sbin/mstat`
- **Location:** `mstat:0x00008ab0 main`
- **Risk Score:** 8.0
- **Confidence:** 8.25
- **Description:** Multiple instances of insecure access to NVRAM variables were identified in the file './sbin/mstat', with the following primary risks:
1. At address 0x00008ab0, the value of the NVRAM variable 'wwan_runtime_manuf' is directly copied to a fixed-size stack buffer (300 bytes) using `strcpy` without length validation, posing a buffer overflow risk.
2. The use of `sprintf` to write formatted strings to stack buffers similarly lacks length checks.
3. Multiple NVRAM variables are accessed through the `acosNvramConfig_get` and `acosNvramConfig_set` functions.

These operations lack boundary checks, which could lead to stack overflow and code execution if NVRAM values are maliciously controlled.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  uVar2 = sym.imp.acosNvramConfig_get(*0x8ef0);
  sym.imp.strcpy(iVar10,uVar2);
  ```
- **Keywords:** acosNvramConfig_get, acosNvramConfig_set, strcpy, sprintf, iVar10, puVar12 + -0x32c, wwan_runtime_manuf
- **Notes:** It is recommended to further analyze the NVRAM variable names and call chains to identify which external inputs may potentially corrupt these variables. Additionally, inspect all code paths that utilize these buffers.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  http_proxy environment variable usage
  ```
- **Keywords:** http_proxy
- **Notes:** Analysis of the string indicates that the specific usage location needs to be confirmed.

### env_get-fcn.00009d0c-SYSFS_PATH

- **File/Directory Path:** `sbin/udevtrigger`
- **Location:** `fcn.00009d0c:0x9d14`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 8.0

### nvram-leafp2p_sys_prefix-access

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/init.d/leafp2p.sh`
- **Location:** `./etc/init.d/leafp2p.sh:5`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** In the file './etc/init.d/leafp2p.sh', access to NVRAM is detected. The script uses the `nvram get` command to retrieve the value of the environment variable `leafp2p_sys_prefix`, which is then used to construct the `CHECK_LEAFNETS` and `PATH` variables. This access method poses potential security risks, as the value of `leafp2p_sys_prefix` is directly utilized to build paths and commands. If this value is maliciously tampered with, it could lead to command injection or path traversal attacks.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER
  SYS_PREFIX=$(${nvram} get leafp2p_sys_prefix)
  CHECK_LEAFNETS=${SYS_PREFIX}/bin/checkleafnets.sh
  PATH=${SYS_PREFIX}/bin:${SYS_PREFIX}/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin
  ```
- **Keywords:** nvram, leafp2p_sys_prefix, CHECK_LEAFNETS, PATH
- **Notes:** It is recommended to further verify the source and potential contamination pathways of `leafp2p_sys_prefix` to ensure its security.
