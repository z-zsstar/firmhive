### local-risk-dhcp6c-unsafe-copy

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/sbin/dhcp6c`
- **Location:** `sym.get_duid:0x40a4f8, sym.configure_ia:0x40e1d8, main:0x402b90`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** Analysis has identified potential security risks in the 'dhcp6c' program, including unsafe usage of `strcpy` and `sprintf`. These vulnerabilities are triggered under conditions related to local data processing rather than web service components. Specific manifestations include:
1. `strcpy` is called in the `sym.get_duid` and `sym.configure_ia` functions to copy data into buffers of unverified size, potentially leading to buffer overflow.
2. `sprintf` is used in the `main` function for formatting file paths, which may cause buffer overflow if user-provided parameters are excessively long.

Since 'dhcp6c' does not directly handle HTTP requests, these vulnerabilities are unrelated to the web service components involved in the user's initial request.
- **Keywords:** strcpy, sprintf, sym.get_duid, sym.configure_ia, main, auStack_124, puVar5, ppuVar14, /var/run/dhcp6c-%s.info
- **Notes:** Although potential security risks were identified, there is no evidence indicating these vulnerabilities can be directly exploited remotely. It is recommended to conduct further analysis of other files to search for vulnerabilities related to web service components.
