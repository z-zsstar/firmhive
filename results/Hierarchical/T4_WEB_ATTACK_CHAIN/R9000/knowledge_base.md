### vulnerability-cgi-buffer_overflow-fcn.000088a8

- **File/Directory Path:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi`
- **Location:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi:fcn.000088a8`
- **Risk Score:** 8.5
- **Confidence:** 7.75
- **Description:** A high-risk buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the file 'www/cgi-bin/proccgi'. The function fcn.000088a8 uses strcpy to copy environment variables obtained from getenv(*0x89e0) without performing length checks. Since this is a CGI program, these environment variables likely contain HTTP request parameters (such as QUERY_STRING or other HTTP header fields). An attacker could trigger a buffer overflow by crafting malicious HTTP request parameters, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  iVar2 = sym.imp.getenv(*0x89e0);
  ...
  sym.imp.strcpy(iVar3,iVar2);
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.000088a8, strcpy, getenv, *0x89e0, QUERY_STRING, proccgi, CGI, HTTP_request
- **Notes:** Since the binary file has been stripped, the specific environment variable name cannot be determined. It is recommended to perform dynamic analysis or reverse engineering to identify the exact environment variable name pointed to by *0x89e0 and verify the exploitability of the vulnerability.

### buffer_overflow-proccgi-URL_decode

- **File/Directory Path:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi`
- **Location:** `proccgi (HIDDEN fcn.000089fc HIDDEN fcn.00008b38)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.5
- **Description:** A potential buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the proccgi file, primarily existing in the URL decoding functionality. The specific manifestations are:
1. The URL decoding function (fcn.000089fc) directly operates on the input buffer without performing length checks or boundary validation
2. The calling function (fcn.00008b38) similarly imposes no restrictions on input length
3. The decoding process includes converting '+' to spaces and handling '%xx' format hexadecimal encoding, which may result in decoded data exceeding the buffer capacity

Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by crafting excessively long URL-encoded parameters, potentially leading to memory corruption, program crashes, or arbitrary code execution.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  puVar4[-1] = uVar8 & 0xff | uVar2;  // HIDDENï¼ŒHIDDEN
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.000089fc, fcn.00008b38, URLHIDDEN, puVar2, puVar4, 0x25, 0x2b
- **Notes:** It is recommended to conduct dynamic testing to verify the exploitability of the vulnerability and check whether other security mechanisms can mitigate this risk.

### buffer_overflow-proccgi-url_decode_fcn.000089fc

- **File/Directory Path:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi`
- **Location:** `fcn.000089fc`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the URL decoding functionality within function fcn.000089fc. When processing URL-encoded strings, this function fails to perform explicit length checks on the output buffer. Specifically, when handling '%'-encoded characters, it directly writes the decoded characters into the destination buffer without proper validation, potentially leading to buffer overflow.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  if (uVar2 == 0x25) {
      iVar1 = puVar5[1] * 2;
      ...
      puVar4[-1] = uVar8 & 0xff | uVar2;
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.000089fc, puVar4, puVar5, 0x25, puVar4[-1], proccgi, url_decode
- **Notes:** It is recommended to verify the buffer size limit passed when calling this function and whether the function is used to process user-controllable HTTP parameters.

### buffer_overflow-proccgi-strcpy_fcn.000088a8

- **File/Directory Path:** `www/cgi-bin/proccgi`
- **Location:** `proccgi:fcn.000088a8`
- **Risk Score:** 7.5
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** A strcpy buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the environment variable handling within function fcn.000088a8. This function retrieves environment variables using getenv and directly copies them into newly allocated memory via strcpy without checking the source string length. Attackers can trigger buffer overflow by manipulating specific environment variables.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  iVar3 = sym.imp.malloc(iVar3 + 1);
  if (iVar3 + 0 != 0) {
      sym.imp.strcpy(iVar3,iVar2);
  }
  ```
- **Keywords:** fcn.000088a8, strcpy, getenv, malloc, proccgi, environment_variable
- **Notes:** Further verification is needed to ensure that the size allocated by malloc is sufficient to accommodate the source string.
