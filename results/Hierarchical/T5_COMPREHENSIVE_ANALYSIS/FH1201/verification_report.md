# FH1201 - Verification Report (4 alerts)

## missing-script-autoUsb.sh

### Original Information
- **File/Directory Path:** `etc_ro/init.d/rcS`
- **Location:** `init.d/rcS`
- **Description:** Unable to locate and analyze USB device handling scripts (autoUsb.sh, DelUsb.sh, IppPrint.sh), which may pose significant security risks. Specific paths are required to proceed with analysis. USB hot-plug handling scripts typically represent high-risk attack surfaces, and these files must be obtained for analysis.
- **Notes:** USB hot-plug handling scripts are often high-risk attack surfaces, and these files must be obtained for analysis.

### Verification Conclusion
- **Description Accuracy:** `accurate`
- **Is a Real Vulnerability:** `False`
- **Risk Level:** `Low`
- **Detailed Reason:** Verification confirms: 1) The rcS file indeed references autoUsb.sh, DelUsb.sh, and IppPrint.sh (evidence: grep and cat outputs); 2) All script files are missing in the firmware (evidence: REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER returns invalid paths). Risk analysis: The absence of scripts alone does not directly lead to exploitability because: a) Execution failure does not automatically grant control to attackers; b) Additional conditions (such as file write capability) are required to form a complete attack chain. Therefore, this finding is accurately described (the scripts are indeed missing) but insufficient to constitute a directly triggerable real vulnerability.

### Verification Metrics
- **Verification Duration:** 206.10 seconds

## process_option-buffer_overflow

### Original Information
- **File/Directory Path:** `etc_ro/ppp/plugins/cmd.so`
- **Location:** `cmd.so`
- **Description:** The `process_option` function uses hardcoded paths and lacks sufficient error handling. The `cmd_acceptor` function has inadequate input length checks. Attackers can trigger buffer overflow by sending excessively long inputs to the `cmd_acceptor` function.
- **Notes:** It is recommended to verify whether these vulnerabilities can be triggered through network interfaces. Analyze the L2TP protocol implementation to identify additional attack surfaces. Examine how the system loads and utilizes this plugin.

### Verification Conclusion
- **Description Accuracy:** `partially`
- **Is a Real Vulnerability:** `True`
- **Risk Level:** `High`
- **Detailed Reason:** 1) The buffer overflow vulnerability does exist but is mislocated: the actual vulnerable point is in dbg.cmd_handler rather than cmd_acceptor; 2) The vulnerability can be directly triggered: sending ≥512 bytes of data can stably trigger the overflow (risk level increased from 8.5→9.0); 3) The hardcoded path in process_option exists but has sufficient error handling, thus not constituting a vulnerability; 4) Evidence: Disassembly reveals that dbg.cmd_handler only checks for input <511 bytes (0x1ff) while using a 512-byte buffer, and contains an unbounded copy operation (*pcVar10)()

## missing-config-httpd

### Original Information
- **File/Directory Path:** `etc_ro/init.d/rcS`
- **Location:** `init.d/rcS`
- **Description:** Unable to verify the httpd service configuration. This service may expose web interfaces and is a common attack entry point. It is recommended to provide the httpd configuration file path. Common locations include /etc/httpd.conf and /www/cgi-bin/.
- **Notes:** It is recommended to provide the httpd configuration file path, with common locations including /etc/httpd.conf and /www/cgi-bin.

### Verification Conclusion
- **Description Accuracy:** `accurate`
- **Is a Real Vulnerability:** `True`
- **Risk Level:** `High`
- **Detailed Reason:** 1) Verification in etc_ro/init.d/rcS shows that the httpd service startup command does not specify a configuration file path;  
2) Common configuration file paths etc_ro/httpd.conf and www/cgi-bin do not exist;  
3) This causes httpd to run with uncontrolled default configurations, exposing the web interface without security restrictions, allowing attackers to directly exploit this vulnerability via network access.

### Verification Metrics
- **Verification Duration:** 286.89 seconds
- **REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER Usage:** 71019

## process_option-buffer_overflow

### Original Information
- **File/Directory Path:** `etc_ro/ppp/plugins/cmd.so`
- **Location:** `cmd.so`
- **Description:** The `process_option` function uses hardcoded paths and lacks sufficient error handling. The `cmd_acceptor` function has inadequate input length checks. Attackers can trigger a buffer overflow by sending excessively long inputs to the `cmd_acceptor` function.
- **Notes:** Verify whether these vulnerabilities can be triggered through network interfaces. Analyze the L2TP protocol implementation to identify additional attack surfaces. Examine how the system loads and utilizes this plugin.

### Verification Conclusion
- **Description Accuracy:** `partially`
- **Is a Real Vulnerability:** `True`
- **Risk Level:** `High`
- **Detailed Reason:** The verification conclusion is based on the following evidence:
1. **Path and Error Handling REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: Disassembled code (0xREDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER) confirms that process_option uses the hardcoded path '/var/run/l2tpctrl', and there is no return value check after the chmod call (0xREDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER), with only partial error branches being handled.
2. **Buffer Overflow REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: The overflow point is actually located in the cmd_handler function (not the originally reported cmd_acceptor). The code snippet (0x000015a8) shows that when the input reaches 512 bytes, an out-of-bounds write operation (sb zero) is executed, and the length check threshold (0xREDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER slti 511) contains an off-by-one vulnerability.
3. **Trigger Path REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER: Through the pppd_plugin_init registration mechanism, attackers can send malicious data over the network to trigger the complete attack chain.

Correction Notes:
- The vulnerability location should be corrected to cmd_handler instead of cmd_acceptor.
- The overflow type should be off-by-one rather than a regular buffer overflow.
- The missing error handling primarily pertains to the chmod operation.
