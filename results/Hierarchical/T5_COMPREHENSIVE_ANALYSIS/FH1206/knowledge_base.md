### ipc-l2tp-control-command

- **File/Directory Path:** `sbin/l2tp-control`
- **Location:** `sbin/l2tp-control: send_cmd`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** Analysis of the 'sbin/l2tp-control' file reveals that the 'send_cmd' function handles L2TP control commands and interacts with the Unix domain socket '/var/run/l2tpctrl'. The function uses 'strncpy' for string operations, showing no obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities. However, the lack of explicit validation for command input length may introduce the following security risks:
1. If command input exceeds the expected size, it could lead to buffer overflow.
2. If special characters are not properly escaped, it may result in command injection.

Potential attack vectors include sending malicious commands through the control socket to exploit unvalidated input lengths or unescaped special characters for executing dangerous operations.
