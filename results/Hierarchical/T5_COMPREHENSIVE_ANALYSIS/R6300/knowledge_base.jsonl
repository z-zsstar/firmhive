The specific manifestation is: when a device hotplug event is triggered, the system executes the command `/sbin/modprobe -q %MODALIAS%`, where %MODALIAS% is directly read from device properties without any filtering. An attacker can forge a hotplug event (such as emulating a malicious USB device) to inject a MODALIAS value containing semicolons or special characters (e.g., `valid_module;malicious_command`), leading to arbitrary command execution.
