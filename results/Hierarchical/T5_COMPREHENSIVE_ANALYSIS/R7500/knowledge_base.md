   - The file 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-script' has globally writable permissions (rwxrwxrwx), allowing any user to modify the script content.
   - Attackers could exploit this permission to alter the script and insert malicious code that would execute when the DHCPv6 client runs the script.

2. **Environment Variable REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:
   - The script processes multiple unvalidated environment variables (REASON, new_domain_name, new_sip_name, etc.).
   - A malicious DHCPv6 server could craft specially designed responses to inject these variables, potentially leading to command injection or configuration tampering.

3. **Privileged Operation REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:
   - The script performs privileged network configuration operations (IP -6 addr del).
   - Terminates critical services (killall dhcp6s, killall radvd).
   - Writes to system-critical files (/tmp/resolv.conf).

4. **Complete Attack REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:
   - An attacker acting as a malicious DHCPv6 server sends crafted responses → triggers script execution → injects malicious commands through environment variables → achieves system configuration modification or privilege escalation.
   - Alternatively, a local attacker directly modifies the script content → waits for DHCPv6 events to trigger → executes arbitrary code.

5. **Trigger REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER:
   - Remote attacks require control of the DHCPv6 server or a man-in-the-middle position.
   - Local attacks require standard user privileges.
   - In both scenarios, the probability of successful exploitation is relatively high.
- **Keywords:** dhcp6c-script, REASON, new_domain_name, new_sip_name, new_domain_name_servers, new_ntp_servers, new_sip_servers, new_prefix, DHCP6S_PD, DHCP6S_DSN, IP, killall, /tmp/resolv.conf
- **Notes:** It is recommended to conduct further analysis on:
1. The DHCPv6 response parsing logic to verify input sanitization mechanisms
2. The invocation context of the script in other scenarios
3. Security considerations regarding the handling of temporary files (/tmp/dhcp6c_script_envs)
4. Implementation security of the called utilities (6service, $CONFIG)
