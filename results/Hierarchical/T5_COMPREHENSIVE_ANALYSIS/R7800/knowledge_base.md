### dnsmasq-dynamic_config-risks

- **File/Directory Path:** `etc/dnsmasq.conf`
- **Location:** `etc/init.d/dnsmasq`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.0
- **Description:** The dnsmasq configuration analysis reveals two REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER security considerations:  
1. Static Configuration: The base 'dnsmasq.conf' file is securely configured with appropriate DNS security measures (bogus-priv, domain-needed, etc.) and contains no sensitive information.  
2. Dynamic Configuration Risks: The init script at 'etc/init.d/dnsmasq' dynamically modifies dnsmasq behavior through:  
   - Parental Control feature creating 'REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER.conf'  
   - WAN interface adjustments based on network mode  
   - PPTP configuration generating '/tmp/pptp.conf'  

These dynamic configurations rely on '$CONFIG get' values that could potentially be influenced by attackers through NVRAM manipulation or other system interfaces. The 'set_hijack' function's use of SIGUSR1 signals to modify dnsmasq behavior also presents a potential attack surface if not properly protected.
- **Keywords:** dnsmasq.conf, ParentalControl, pptp.conf, set_hijack, CONFIG_get, wan_proto, ap_mode, bridge_mode, SIGUSR1
- **Notes:** Recommended next steps:
1. Trace the source and validation process of the '$CONFIG get' value to assess the possibility of NVRAM tampering
2. Analyze the security of temporary configuration files in the /tmp directory
3. Examine whether race conditions exist in the signal handling mechanism of dnsmasq
4. Verify the permission settings of dnsmasq-related files and processes
