### web-upload-system_upgrade

- **File/Directory Path:** `webroot/system_upgrade.asp`
- **Location:** `system_upgrade.asp`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 7.25
- **Description:** The file 'webroot/system_upgrade.asp' contains a system upgrade functionality that submits via form to '/cgi-bin/upgrade'. The client-side performs validation on uploaded file extensions (.bin or .trx), but lacks strict server-side validation. The upload progress and reboot logic are entirely controlled by client-side JavaScript (setpanel and uploading functions), posing a risk of tampering. After form submission, the page simulates a progress bar via JavaScript, but the actual security of the upgrade process relies on server-side implementation.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  function uploading() {
    if (document.form_update.upgradeFile.value == ""){
      alert("Please select a firmware file first!");
      return ;
    }
    if(confirm('Are you sure you want to update your device?')){
      document.getElementById("td_step").style.display = "block";
      setTimeout("document.form_update.submit()", 100);
      document.getElementById("bt_update").disabled = true;
    }
  }
  ```
- **Keywords:** upgradeFile, form_update, /cgi-bin/upgrade, uploading(), setpanel(), chgStatus()
- **Notes:** Further analysis of the server-side implementation of '/cgi-bin/upgrade' is required to confirm the existence of file upload vulnerabilities. Client-side validation can be bypassed, and the lack of server-side validation may lead to arbitrary file uploads. The progress bar simulation could potentially obscure security issues during the actual upgrade process.
