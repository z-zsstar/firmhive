- **File/Directory Path:** `sbin/ubusd`
- **Location:** `/var/run/ubus.sock`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.5
- **Description:** ubusd uses /var/run/ubus.sock for inter-process communication, which may be hijacked if permissions are improperly configured. Relevant functions include uloop_run, uloop_fd_add, and usock. Attackers could potentially perform man-in-the-middle attacks by controlling socket input or exploiting misconfigured socket permissions.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  usock(USOCK_UNIX | USOCK_SERVER, "/var/run/ubus.sock", ...);
  ```
- **Keywords:** /var/run/ubus.sock, uloop_run, usock
- **Notes:** Check the socket file permissions and ACL file parsing logic to confirm the possibility of privilege escalation.

- **File/Directory Path:** `usr/sbin/hostapd`
- **Location:** `usr/sbin/hostapd:0x13ac0 (fcn.00013a90)`
- **Risk Score:** 7.0
- **Confidence:** 6.25
- **Description:** Buffer overflow (fcn.00013a90): strcpy copies environment variable contents into a 512-byte stack buffer, where attacker-controlled environment variables can cause overflow. Trigger conditions include: 1. Attacker can control environment variables; 2. Environment variable content exceeds 512 bytes. Potential impacts include stack overflow, which may lead to arbitrary code execution or program crash.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  char auStack_210[512];
  strcpy(auStack_210, getenv("ATTACKER_CONTROLLED"));
  ```
- **Keywords:** strcpy, auStack_210, fcn.00013a90, hostapd
- **Notes:** The attacker needs to be able to control the environment variables to trigger this vulnerability.
