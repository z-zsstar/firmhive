## configuration_load-getty-buffer_overflow

### Original Information
- **File/Directory Path:** `sbin/getty`
- **Location:** `sbin/getty:0x11644`
- **Description:** A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in function fcn.0001154c (0x11644): strcpy copies a user-controllable terminal device path (from /etc/inittab) to a fixed-size buffer (at 260-byte offset) without length validation. An attacker can trigger overflow by injecting an overlong path (>40 bytes) through tampering with /etc/inittab. Trigger conditions: 1) Attacker requires modification privileges for /etc/inittab (obtainable via firmware update vulnerabilities or filesystem vulnerabilities); 2) System reboot or init reloading configuration; 3) getty running with REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges. Successful exploitation could achieve code execution or privilege escalation.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  strcpy(iVar3 + 0x104, param_3);
  ```
- **Notes:** Associated knowledge base keywords: /sbin/getty. Subsequent verification: 1) Whether getty runs as REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER 2) Analyze memory layout (ASLR/PIE) 3) Track /etc/inittab modification attack surface

### Verification Conclusion
- **Description Accuracy:** `accurate`
- **Is a Real Vulnerability:** `True`
- **Risk Level:** `Low`
- **Detailed Reason:** 1) Code evidence is conclusive: after calloc(300) allocates heap memory, strcpy writes to a +0x104 offset, leaving 40 bytes of space vulnerable to overflow overwrite;  
2) Input is fully controllable: param_3 is directly sourced from /etc/inittab parsing with no filtering mechanism;  
3) Runs with REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER privileges: setuid bit confirms privilege escalation potential;  
4) Non-immediate trigger requires system REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER reload, but the attack chain is complete: tamper with inittab → trigger parsing → overflow execution. The risk assessment is justified (CVSS 8.5), constituting a genuine vulnerability.

### Verification Metrics
- **Verification Duration:** 482.09 seconds
- **REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER Usage:** 253528

## network_input-load.js-ctf_effect_request

### Original Information
- **File/Directory Path:** `web/dynaform/load.js`
- **Location:** `load.js:163-175`
- **Description:** Unfiltered API parameter passing: The pagename parameter is directly sent to the '../data/ctf_effect.json' endpoint via $.getJSON. Attackers can inject malicious payloads (such as path traversal ../ or command injection characters). The risk depends on the backend: 1) If the backend directly concatenates commands (e.g., system() calls), it could lead to RCE. 2) If the response contains sensitive data (json.fastpath), it could result in information leakage. Trigger condition: Accessing a page containing a malicious pagename. Boundary check: The current file has zero filtering, and the backend validation mechanism is unknown.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```
  $.getJSON("../data/ctf_effect.json", {pagename: pageName}, function (json){
    if (type == 0) flag = json.reboot ? true : false;
    else flag = json.fastpath === "Enable" ? true : false;
  });
  ```
- **Notes:** The REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER pollution source 'pagename' originates from a URL parsing vulnerability (see lines 201-208 in this file). Reverse engineering of the httpd component is required to verify the backend processing logic. Related records: network_input-loadUS.js-ctf_effect_request

### Verification Conclusion
- **Description Accuracy:** `partially`
- **Is a Real Vulnerability:** `False`
- **Risk Level:** `High`
- **Detailed Reason:** Front-end validation confirms that the pageName parameter is unfiltered and originates from a URL parsing vulnerability (load.js:201-208), consistent with the discovery description. However, the critical back-end processing logic resides in the ./usr/bin/httpd binary file, and current analysis tools cannot extract verifiable evidence. The described back-end risks (RCE/information leakage) lack concrete code support:
1. No evidence indicates the back-end uses dangerous functions like system() to process the pagename parameter
2. While front-end code shows it reads the json.fastpath field, whether this field contains sensitive data depends on back-end implementation
3. The trigger condition (accessing a malicious URL) has been validated on the front-end

Conclusion: The front-end vulnerability chain exists and can be directly triggered, but forming a complete vulnerability requires unverified back-end risk conditions. Therefore, this does not constitute a fully verified real vulnerability.
