This backdoor was intentionally inserted and allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code by triggering a shell on port 6200. The attack chain is as follows: 1) The attacker connects to the FTP server and provides a USER command with a username containing ':)' (e.g., 'USER x:)'). 2) The server processes this input and, due to the backdoor code, opens a shell listener on port 6200. 3) The attacker can then connect to port 6200 to gain a root shell, enabling full system compromise.
