The service uses unsanitized user input from the NewInternalClient parameter when constructing iptables commands via snprintf, which are then executed via system(). An attacker with valid login credentials (and thus network access) can send a malicious UPnP request with a crafted NewInternalClient value containing shell metacharacters (e.g., semicolons or backticks) to break out of the iptables command and execute arbitrary commands.

This breaks out of the iptables command and executes arbitrary commands with root privileges. For example:\n- Craft a UPnP SOAP request with NewInternalClient set to '192.168.1.100; touch /tmp/pwned #'.\n- The snprintf constructs: 'iptables -t nat -A CHAIN -d EXTERNAL_IP -p PROTO --dport EXTERNAL_PORT -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.100; touch /tmp/pwned #:INTERNAL_PORT'.\n- system() executes this, running the malicious command 'touch /tmp/pwned' as root.\n\nThis confirms a full attack chain from input control to command execution."}, "verification_duration_seconds": 326.97782349586487, "verification_token_usage": 629675}
