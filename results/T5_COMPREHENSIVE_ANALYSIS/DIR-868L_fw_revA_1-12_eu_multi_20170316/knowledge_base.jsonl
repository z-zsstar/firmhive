{"name": "Heap-Buffer-Overflow-esp_new", "location": "nf_conntrack_ipsec_pass.ko:0x080003a4 sym.esp_new", "description": "The 'esp_new' function in the IPSEC connection tracking helper module contains a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. The function allocates a 32-byte buffer using 'kmem_cache_alloc' but subsequently performs two 'memcpy' operations of 40 bytes each into this buffer at offsets 8 and 0x30, resulting in writes beyond the allocated memory (first copy overflows by 16 bytes, second copy writes completely outside the buffer). This occurs when creating a new connection tracking entry for IPSEC traffic. An attacker with valid login credentials (non-root) can exploit this by sending crafted IPSEC packets that trigger the function, leading to kernel heap corruption. This could be leveraged for privilege escalation, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution in kernel space, depending on heap layout and exploitation techniques.", "link_identifiers": ["nf_conntrack_ipsec_pass.ko", "esp_new", "kmem_cache_alloc", "memcpy"], "code_snippet": "0x080004a8      2010a0e3       mov r1, 0x20                ; Allocation size 32 bytes\n0x080004ac      feffffeb       bl kmem_cache_alloc         ; RELOC 24 kmem_cache_alloc\n0x080004c0      080084e2       add r0, r4, 8               ; Destination at offset 8\n0x080004c4      feffffeb       bl memcpy                   ; RELOC 24 memcpy, size 0x28 (40 bytes)\n0x080004d0      300084e2       add r0, r4, 0x30            ; Destination at offset 0x30 (48)\n0x080004d4      feffffeb       bl memcpy                   ; RELOC 24 memcpy, size 0x28 (40 bytes)", "risk_score": 8.5, "confidence": 9.0, "notes": "The vulnerability is directly evidenced by the disassembly, showing allocation of 32 bytes but copies of 40 bytes.
