A fixed-size 1024-byte stack buffer is initialized with 'HELO ' (5 bytes), and strcat is used to append param_2 without length validation. If param_2 exceeds 1019 bytes, it overflows the buffer. The return address is located 1068 bytes from the buffer start, allowing arbitrary code execution by crafting a long param_2. Attackers with valid login credentials can exploit this by setting a malicious SMTP server address in device configuration (e.g., via web interface or NVRAM), triggering the overflow when SendEmail is called during email alert operations.
