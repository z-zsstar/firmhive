Trigger condition: When an attacker invokes the script and specifies --exec-prefix to point to a directory they control, and creates a malicious file name containing shell metacharacters (such as a semicolon) in that directory, causing the configmask to match that file. When the script delegates execution, because the variables are not quoted/escaped, the shell interprets the metacharacters in the file name as command separators, leading to command injection. Exploitation method: An attacker can place a file with a name like 'malicious; echo hacked;' and use options to make the configmask match it, thereby executing the injected command. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have write permissions to the target directory, but as a non-root user, they might control the home directory or temporary directories.", "link_identifiers": ["input_option_exec_prefix", "input_option_prefix", "wxconfdir", "configmask", "best_delegate"], "code_snippet": "# Delegate execution code snippet\nif [ $_numdelegates -eq 1 ]; then\n    $wxconfdir/`find_eligible_delegates $configmask` $*\n    exit\nfi\n\n# Or use best_delegate\nif [ -n \"$best_delegate\" ]; then\n    $wxconfdir/$best_delegate $*\n    exit\nfi", "risk_score": 7.5, "confidence": 8.0, "notes": "The vulnerability relies on the attacker being able to control the --exec-prefix directory and file names.
