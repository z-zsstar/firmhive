The vulnerability is triggered when a non-root user with login credentials executes iptables commands with malicious --l7proto or --l7dir values, such as specifying a protocol name like '../../etc/passwd' to access sensitive files. While direct code execution is not achieved, information disclosure occurs if the targeted file exists and is readable by the user. This represents a complete attack chain from untrusted input (command-line) to dangerous operation (file read).", "link_identifiers": ["--l7proto", "--l7dir"], "code_snippet": "From decompilation: `iVar4 = sym.imp.snprintf(puVar21 + -0x20c, 0x100, iVar5 + 0xcb8, pcVar16);` where pcVar16 is derived from user input (--l7proto or directory entries), and the format string (e.g., '%s/%s/%s.pat') incorporates this input into the path.", "risk_score": 5.0, "confidence": 8.0, "notes": "This vulnerability could be part of a broader attack chain if combined with other weaknesses (e.g., misconfigured file permissions). No evidence of buffer overflows was found; strcpy and strncpy uses appear safe due to bounds checks (e.g., malloc based on strlen). Further analysis of caller functions in iptables might reveal additional interaction points.", "file_path": "usr/lib/iptables/libxt_layer7.so"}
