It is recommended to analyze the netlink protocol and access controls to assess the completeness of the attack chain. The vulnerability depends on specific conditions, but the input point is clear.", "file_path": "sbin/ubdcmd"}, "verification_result": {"accuracy": "accurate", "vulnerability": true, "risk_level": "Medium", "reason": "The alert accurately describes the buffer over-read vulnerability in function 0x8e74 of 'sbin/ubdcmd'. Evidence from Radare2 decompilation confirms: 1) The format string for fprintf is '%s\\n' at address 0x9ce4, referenced by *0x8f00. 2) The buffer at puVar2 + -0x404 is initialized with memset and filled via fcn.00008b98, which copies 0x420 bytes from a netlink socket using memcpy without null termination. 3) The condition *(puVar2 + -0x40c) != 1 triggers the fprintf call, and this value is within the netlink data buffer (at offset 24 bytes), allowing attacker control. 4) The netlink socket is created with socket(0x10, 3, 0x11) and bound to the process ID, making it accessible to an authenticated non-root user who can send messages to the correct port when ubdcmd is running. If the netlink data lacks a null terminator within the 0x420-byte buffer, fprintf will read beyond the buffer boundary, leaking adjacent stack memory (e.g., stack canaries, pointers). This information disclosure could facilitate ASLR bypass or other attacks. Exploitability requires the attacker to send a crafted netlink message that sets the 4-byte value at offset 24 to not equal 1 and ensures no null byte in the data starting from offset 32, causing over-read. PoC steps: 1) Identify when ubdcmd is running and its PID. 2) Craft a netlink message with the first 0x420 bytes containing no null bytes, set bytes 24-27 to a value other than 1, and ensure bytes 32 onward have no null byte. 3) Send the message to the netlink socket using the PID. 4) Observe leaked stack data via fprintf output. The vulnerability is verified as real and exploitable under the assumed attacker model."}, "verification_duration_seconds": 730.1905128955841, "verification_token_usage": 1431601}
