{"description": "When parsing a SOAP SetParameterValues request, the function uses strncpy to copy parameter values to a small buffer on the stack, but does not adequately validate the input length, leading to a stack buffer overflow. The specific issue occurs when processing string-type parameter values: the code uses strncpy(&uStack_c28, uStack_f30, iVar7), where &uStack_c28 may point to a small stack buffer (possibly only 1 byte), and iVar7 is a controllable length from the input. If iVar7 is sufficiently large, it will overwrite the return address or other critical data on the stack, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The trigger condition is sending a SetParameterValues SOAP request containing a long parameter value. Potential exploitation methods include overwriting the return address to control program flow, potentially achieving code execution on MIPS architecture through a carefully crafted payload. An attacker, as a logged-in non-root user, can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request via the network or local interface.", "link_identifiers": ["SOAP SetParameterValues Request", "ParameterValue Parameter", "cwmp Service Network Interface"], "location": "bin/cwmp:0x00404974 In function parseSetParameterValues (fcn.00404974)", "code_snippet": "// Relevant code snippet extracted from decompilation:\nsym.imp.strncpy(&uStack_c28, uStack_f30, iVar7);\n*(*0x74 + iVar7 + -0xc28) = 0;\nsym.imp.xml_unescapeString(&uStack_c28, iVar7 + 1, iVar2);\n// Where iVar7 is the length of the parameter value, from the input and controllable; &uStack_c28 is the stack buffer address.", "risk_score": 8.0, "confidence": 8.0, "notes": "This vulnerability requires further validation to confirm exploitability, such as through dynamic testing or building a complete attack payload.

{"description": "In the function 'reply_sesssetup_and_X' when processing SMB session setup requests, there exists a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. Specific manifestation: When the first byte of the request data is not 'N', '`', or 0xa1, it enters the hexadecimal encoding path, using a fixed-size stack buffer (256 bytes). The input data length (iStack_788) comes from a user-controlled SMB request field (such as offset 0x33, 0x34 of param_2), and its size is not sufficiently validated. If the input data length is greater than 128 bytes, the hexadecimal encoding loop writes beyond the buffer boundary (for example, with a length of 129, it writes from index 0 to 257, while the buffer size is only 256 bytes), causing a stack overflow that may overwrite the return address or other critical data. Trigger condition: An attacker sends an SMB session setup request where the data part length is greater than 128 bytes and the first byte does not match the specific values. Constraints and boundary checks: The code lacks strict validation of the input data length, only checking via the loop condition, but the buffer size is fixed. Potential attacks and exploitation methods: An attacker can overwrite the return address with carefully crafted overflow data, control the program execution flow, and achieve arbitrary code execution.
