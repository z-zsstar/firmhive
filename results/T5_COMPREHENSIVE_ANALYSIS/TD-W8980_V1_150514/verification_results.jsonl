{"verification_task": {"description": "In the function 'reply_sesssetup_and_X' when processing SMB session setup requests, there exists a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. Specific manifestation: When the first byte of the request data is not 'N', '`', or 0xa1, it enters the hexadecimal encoding path, using a fixed-size stack buffer (256 bytes). The input data length (iStack_788) comes from a user-controlled SMB request field (e.g., offset 0x33, 0x34 of param_2), and its size is not sufficiently validated. If the input data length is greater than 128 bytes, the hexadecimal encoding loop writes beyond the buffer boundary (for example, with a length of 129, it writes from index 0 to 257, while the buffer size is only 256 bytes), causing a stack overflow that may overwrite the return address or other critical data. Trigger condition: An attacker sends an SMB session setup request where the data part length is greater than 128 bytes and the first byte does not match specific values. Constraints and boundary checks: The code lacks strict validation of the input data length, only checking via the loop condition, but the buffer size is fixed.
