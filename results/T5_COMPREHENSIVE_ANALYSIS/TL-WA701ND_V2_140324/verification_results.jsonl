Potential exploitation methods include stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or performing unauthorized operations.

When the loop count reaches the maximum value (iVar4=2), the write position exceeds the boundary of 'cStack_174', overwriting adjacent stack variables such as 'auStack_173' and 'iStack_168'. An attacker can manipulate the written values by controlling command line parameters (such as iteration count, offset value), thereby overwriting the return address or critical stack data.
