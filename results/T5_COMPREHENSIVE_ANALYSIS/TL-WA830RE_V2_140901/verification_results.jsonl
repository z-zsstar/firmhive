User-provided input for the essid is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer (296 bytes) using strncpy with the length set to the string length (strlen). This can result in buffer overflow if the input exceeds 296 bytes, as strncpy does not null-terminate the destination when the source length is greater than or equal to the specified count. The lack of null termination may cause subsequent string operations to read beyond the buffer, leading to information disclosure or further memory corruption. Under specific conditions, an attacker could overwrite stack variables, including the return address, to achieve arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is triggered by running 'iwlist scanning essid <long_string>' where <long_string> is longer than 296 bytes. Potential attacks include local code execution by a non-root user, which could be leveraged for further exploitation if combined with other vulnerabilities.", "code_snippet": "// From decompilation at ~0x00403c00 in fcn.00403b78\nuStack_3cf = (**(loc._gp + -0x7f2c))(pcVar10); // strlen(pcVar10) where pcVar10 is user input\n(**(loc._gp + -0x7ef0))(auStack_3bc, pcVar10, uStack_3cf); // strncpy(auStack_3bc, pcVar10, uStack_3cf)\n// auStack_3bc is a stack buffer of 296 bytes", "risk_score": 6.5, "notes": "The binary has permissions -rwxrwxrwx, allowing execution by any user.

Evidence comes from decompiled code: when processing the 'essid' option, user input is copied into a 296-byte stack buffer auStack_3bc using strncpy with the length set to strlen(input). If the input exceeds 296 bytes, strncpy does not null-terminate the destination buffer, potentially causing buffer overflow and memory corruption. The attacker model is a local non-privileged user (no special permissions required), triggered by running 'iwlist scanning essid <long_string>' where <long_string> is longer than 296 bytes. Vulnerability exploitability verification: input is controllable (command line argument), path is reachable (code execution reaches the vulnerable branch), actual impact may include overwriting stack variables (such as iStack_3cc) and the return address, leading to arbitrary code execution. Since the binary permissions are -rwxrwxrwx (executable by any user) but not setuid, the vulnerability does not directly lead to privilege escalation, but could be combined with other vulnerabilities for exploitation. Proof of Concept (PoC): running the command 'iwlist scanning essid $(python -c \"print 'A'*300\")' can trigger the overflow. The risk level is Medium because the vulnerability requires local access and provides no direct privilege escalation, but could be used for further attacks."}, "verification_duration_seconds": 259.33221983909607, "verification_token_usage": 152138}

When processing events from wpa_supplicant, if the event string contains 'CONNECTED', the function extracts the substring after 'CONNECTED' and passes it directly to the 'system' function without validation. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious SSID or other network parameter that includes 'CONNECTED' followed by a command. For example, setting the SSID to 'CONNECTED; malicious_command' via the 'set_network' command and triggering a connection would cause wpa_supplicant to send an event string containing 'CONNECTED; malicious_command', leading to command execution when processed by wpa_cli.
