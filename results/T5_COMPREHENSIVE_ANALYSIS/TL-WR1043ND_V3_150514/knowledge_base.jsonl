An attacker logged in as a non-root user can easily read this file, extract the root's MD5 hash, and use tools (such as John the Ripper or hashcat) to crack it. Since MD5 is vulnerable to rainbow table or brute-force attacks, if the password is weak, the attacker may obtain the root password, thereby achieving privilege escalation. The trigger condition is simple: the attacker only needs valid non-root login credentials and permission to execute file read commands. Constraint conditions include password complexity, but the weak hash algorithm lowers the cracking threshold. Potential attack methods include offline hash cracking, and upon success, executing arbitrary commands as root.", "link_identifiers": ["/etc/shadow"], "code_snippet": "root:$1$GTN.gpri$DlSyKvZKMR9A9Uj9e9wR3/:15502:0:99999:7:::", "risk_score": 8.0, "confidence": 9.0, "notes": "Evidence is based on file content and permission checks.

This function is used to parse the MAC address string provided via the command line, using sscanf with the '%1X%1X' format to parse each pair of hexadecimal digits and write them to the provided buffer. Vulnerability trigger condition: When parsing a standard 6-byte MAC address string (such as '11:22:33:44:55:66'), the function increments the index and writes to the buffer within a loop before checking the buffer size. Because the write occurs before the check, when the index equals the buffer size (typically 6), a 7th byte is written, causing a buffer overflow. An attacker can provide a malicious string by controlling the MAC address parameter (such as mac_addr in the sendbcnrpt or sendtsmrpt operations), potentially overwriting adjacent variables on the stack (such as the return address or pointers), which may lead to arbitrary code execution.
