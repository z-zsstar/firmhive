Based on the Radare2 analysis of the binary file 'web/cgi-bin/audio/ACAS-AAC.cgi', the evidence is as follows:\n- Code Logic Verification: In the loop of the main function (address 0x400f20), pfRead is called to read audio data, and the return value is stored in s2. Subsequently, the first skAsyncWrite uses a fixed offset 0x1c and size 0x28 (address 0x400f58-0x400f68). The second skAsyncWrite uses offset 0x44 and size s2 - 0x44 (address 0x400f78-0x400f80). If pfRead returns less than 0x44 bytes, s2 - 0x44 becomes a negative number, which is interpreted as an unsigned integer (a large positive number) when passed to skAsyncWrite, causing it to read memory beyond the buffer boundaries.\n- Input Controllability: The attacker model is an unauthenticated remote attacker who can control the input source of pfRead (e.g., via a malicious audio file or network stream), influencing its return value. The program, as a CGI executable, likely processes audio data via HTTP requests, making remote exploitation feasible.\n- Path Reachability: The loop is reachable within the main function. The code shows the loop condition (address 0x400fa0) depends on an external state (s3 + 0x14b0), but there is no bounds check ensuring the pfRead return value >= 0x44. An attacker can trigger this path by sending short audio data.\n- Actual Impact: The out-of-bounds read may lead to memory disclosure (leaking heap or stack data, such as pointers or sensitive information), which could be used to bypass ASLR or for other attacks; or it may cause a program crash (denial of service). While it does not directly lead to code execution, information disclosure could aid further exploitation.\n- Complete Attack Chain: The attacker prepares malicious audio data (e.g., a stream shorter than 0x44 bytes) and sends it to the program over the network. When pfRead returns N < 0x44, the second skAsyncWrite reads (2^32 + N - 0x44) bytes starting from buffer offset 0x44, exceeding the boundary.
