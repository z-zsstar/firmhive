Evidence verification is as follows: 1) Function call chain exists: sym.process_v2_packet (0x0004be90) calls sym.complete_v2_state_transition (0x0004d670), which calls sym.success_v2_state_transition (0x0004ce3c), ultimately calling sym.leak_pfree (0x000b7dc8). 2) Code snippet at 0x0004d23c-0x0004d258 is confirmed: ldr r3, [var_34h] loads tainted pointer (from packet), ldr r2, [r3, 0x240] dereferences pointer to get memory address, mov r0, r2 passes the address, bl sym.leak_pfree calls memory deallocation. Attacker model: authenticated user (authenticated via IKE protocol, possibly remote) sends a specially crafted version 2 ISAKMP packet. Vulnerability exploitability verification: input controllable (packet fields such as state pointers can be manipulated), path reachable (call chain triggers during normal processing flow), actual impact (arbitrary memory deallocation may lead to use-after-free, double-free, memory corruption, or code execution). Proof of Concept (PoC) steps: 1) Attacker, as an authenticated user, constructs a malicious version 2 ISAKMP packet containing a carefully crafted state pointer, controlling the value of var_34h; 2) Sends the packet to the Pluto daemon; 3) The packet enters processing via sym.process_v2_packet, propagating tainted data; 4) Finally, sym.leak_pfree deallocates memory at the attacker-specified address, triggering the vulnerability. This vulnerability is high risk because it may allow remote code execution or denial of service."}, "verification_duration_seconds": 379.6939513683319, "verification_token_usage": 434222}
