The binary has 777 permissions but no setuid, so privilege escalation depends on the context of execution. The stack buffer in main is at offset -0x214 from SP, and overwriting beyond this can reach the return address. Exploitation may require MIPS-specific shellcode or ROP chains. Further analysis could involve determining the exact offset to the return address and developing a working exploit.", "file_path": "usr/sbin/modem"}
