{"name": "Shadow-File-Permission-Misconfig", "location": "shadow:1", "description": "The shadow file has global read, write, and execute permissions (777), which is a serious security misconfiguration that allows any user (including non-root users) to read the root user's password hash. The hash uses the weak MD5 algorithm ($1$), making it vulnerable to offline brute-force attacks. An attacker, as a logged-in non-root user, can execute 'cat /etc/shadow' or similar commands to directly obtain the hash, then use tools like John the Ripper or hashcat to crack it. If the root password is weak (e.g., common or short passwords), the attacker can crack it in a relatively short time and gain root privileges. The trigger condition is simple: the attacker only needs shell access and to execute a read command. Constraints include the attacker needing valid login credentials, but as a non-root user, they should not have access to the shadow file. Potential attacks include privilege escalation to root, resulting in complete control of the device.
