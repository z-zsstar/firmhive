{"name": "CommandInjection-hotplug_net", "location": "rc:0x0040d1b8 hotplug_net", "description": "In the 'rc' binary's hotplug_net function, a command injection vulnerability was discovered. When handling network interface hotplug events, the function reads the interface name from the INTERFACE environment variable and directly uses it to construct and execute system commands (such as brctl addif). If an attacker can control the INTERFACE variable (for example, through malicious hotplug events or environment variable injection), arbitrary commands can be injected. Trigger conditions include: 1) A hotplug event is triggered (such as interface addition); 2) The INTERFACE variable contains a malicious payload (such as commands separated by semicolons or backticks). Potential attack methods include executing arbitrary system commands, which may lead to privilege escalation or device control. The constraint is that the attacker needs valid login credentials (non-root) and must be able to influence the environment variables.", "link_identifiers": ["INTERFACE", "ACTION", "/dev/console", "brctl", "system"], "code_snippet": "// Read INTERFACE from environment variable\niVar2 = (*pcVar6)(*(iVar7 + -0x7fe4) + -0x72a8); // INTERFACE\n// Construct and execute command\n(**(iStack_58 + -0x7e38))(&iStack_38,*(iStack_58 + -0x7fdc) + 0x7a88,0,0); // system call\n// Command example: brctl addif br0 <INTERFACE>", "risk_score": 7.5, "confidence": 8.0, "notes": "This vulnerability chain involves a complete data flow from untrusted input (environment variables) to dangerous operations (system calls).

{"name": "StackOverflow-agDoIoctl", "location": "acos_nat.ko:0x08035950 agDoIoctl", "description": "The function 'agDoIoctl' at address 0x08035950 contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability when handling multiple ioctl commands. Specifically, for ioctl commands such as 0x40046427, 0x4004643c, and others, the function copies 0x104 (260) bytes from user-space pointer 'param_4' to a fixed-size stack buffer starting at '&iStack_344' without verifying the size of the destination buffer. The stack buffer has a limited size (approximately 244 bytes based on stack layout), and copying 260 bytes overflows the buffer, potentially overwriting critical stack data including the return address. An attacker with access to the device file can trigger this by issuing a crafted ioctl call with a large buffer, leading to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode and privilege escalation.", "link_identifiers": ["agDoIoctl", "param_4", "iStack_344"], "code_snippet": "// Example for ioctl command 0x40046427\nif (param_3 == 0x40046427) {\n    // ...\n    if (((param_4 + 0x41 | param_4) & *(unaff_gp + 0x18)) == 0) {\n        (*NULL)(&iStack_344, param_4, 0x104); // Copy 260 bytes from user to stack\n    }\n    // ...\n}", "risk_score": 9.0, "confidence": 8.5, "notes": "The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the device file associated with this kernel module.

Exploitation may require bypassing kernel protections like SMEP or KASLR, but the overflow is straightforward.
