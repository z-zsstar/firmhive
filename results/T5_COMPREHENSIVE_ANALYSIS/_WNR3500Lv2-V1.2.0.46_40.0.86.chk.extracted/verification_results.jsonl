{"verification_task": {"location": "acos_nat.ko:0x08035950 agDoIoctl", "description": "The function 'agDoIoctl' at address 0x08035950 contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability when handling multiple ioctl commands. Specifically, for ioctl commands such as 0x40046427, 0x4004643c, and others, the function copies 0x104 (260) bytes from user-space pointer 'param_4' to a fixed-size stack buffer starting at '&iStack_344' without verifying the size of the destination buffer. The stack buffer has a limited size (approximately 244 bytes based on stack layout), and copying 260 bytes overflows the buffer, potentially overwriting critical stack data including the return address. An attacker with access to the device file can trigger this by issuing a crafted ioctl call with a large buffer, leading to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode and privilege escalation.", "code_snippet": "// Example for ioctl command 0x40046427\nif (param_3 == 0x40046427) {\n    // ...\n    if (((param_4 + 0x41 | param_4) & *(unaff_gp + 0x18)) == 0) {\n        (*NULL)(&iStack_344, param_4, 0x104); // Copy 260 bytes from user to stack\n    }\n    // ...\n}", "risk_score": 9.0, "notes": "The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the device file associated with this kernel module.

Exploitation may require bypassing kernel protections like SMEP or KASLR, but the overflow is straightforward.

{"verification_task": {"location": "rc:0x0040d1b8 hotplug_net", "description": "In the hotplug_net function of the 'rc' binary, a command injection vulnerability was discovered. When handling network interface hotplug events, the function reads the interface name from the INTERFACE environment variable and directly uses it to construct and execute system commands (such as brctl addif). If an attacker can control the INTERFACE variable (for example, through malicious hotplug events or environment variable injection), arbitrary commands can be injected. Trigger conditions include: 1) A hotplug event is triggered (such as interface addition); 2) The INTERFACE variable contains a malicious payload (such as commands separated by semicolons or backticks). Potential attack methods include executing arbitrary system commands, which may lead to privilege escalation or device control. The constraint is that the attacker needs valid login credentials (non-root) and must be able to influence environment variables.", "code_snippet": "// Read INTERFACE from environment variable\niVar2 = (*pcVar6)(*(iVar7 + -0x7fe4) + -0x72a8); // INTERFACE\n// Construct and execute command\n(**(iStack_58 + -0x7e38))(&iStack_38,*(iStack_58 + -0x7fdc) + 0x7a88,0,0); // system call\n// Command example: brctl addif br0 <INTERFACE>", "risk_score": 7.5, "notes": "This vulnerability chain involves a complete data flow from untrusted input (environment variables) to dangerous operations (system calls).

The disassembled code shows: 1) At address 0x0040d20c, the function calls getenv(\"INTERFACE\") to read the environment variable, storing the value in the s2 register; 2) At address 0x0040d350, the function calls _eval (a wrapper similar to system) to execute a command, with parameters including a string array constructed by directly using s2 (the INTERFACE value), such as 'brctl addif br0 <INTERFACE>'. There is no input validation or escaping, allowing command injection. Attacker model: A user with valid login credentials (non-root) can control the INTERFACE variable through hotplug events (such as interface addition) or environment variable injection. Path reachability: The code path is executed when the ACTION environment variable is 'add' (address 0x0040d294). Actual impact: Arbitrary command execution can lead to complete device control. Complete attack chain: Attacker sets INTERFACE to a malicious value → Triggers a hotplug event → hotplug_net executes → _eval call injects the command. PoC steps: 1) Set the INTERFACE environment variable to 'eth0; touch /tmp/poc'; 2) Trigger a network interface hotplug event (e.g., execute 'echo add > /sys/class/net/eth0/uevent' or a similar mechanism); 3) Verify that the '/tmp/poc' file is created, indicating successful command injection. The vulnerability risk is high because it can lead to privilege escalation or device control."}, "verification_duration_seconds": 169.7526500225067, "verification_token_usage": 66312}
