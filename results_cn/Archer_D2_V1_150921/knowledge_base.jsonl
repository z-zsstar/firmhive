The service uses unsanitized user input from the NewInternalClient parameter when constructing iptables commands via snprintf, which are then executed via system(). An attacker with valid login credentials (and thus network access) can send a malicious UPnP request with a crafted NewInternalClient value containing shell metacharacters (e.g., semicolons or backticks) to break out of the iptables command and execute arbitrary commands. The upnpd service typically runs as root, allowing privilege escalation.
